227.7103-5,Government rights.,"The standard license rights that a licensor grants to the Government are unlimited rights, government purpose rights, or limited rights.  Those rights are defined in the clause at 252.227-7013 , Rights in Technical Data–Noncommercial Items.  In unusual situations, the standard rights may not satisfy the Government's needs or the Government may be willing to accept lesser rights in data in return for other consideration.  In those cases, a special license may be negotiated.  However, the licensor is not obligated to provide the Government greater rights and the contracting officer is not required to accept lesser rights than the rights provided in the standard grant of license.  The situations under which a particular grant of license applies are enumerated in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this subsection.
(a) Unlimited rights .  The Government obtains unlimited rights in technical data that are—
(1)  Data pertaining to an item, component, or process which has been or will be developed exclusively with Government funds;
(2)  Studies, analyses, test data, or similar data produced in the performance of a contract when the study, analysis, test, or similar work was specified as an element of performance;
(3)  Created exclusively with Government funds in the performance of a contract that does not require the development, manufacture, construction, or production of items, components, or processes;
(4)  Form, fit, and function data;
(5)  Necessary for installation, operation, maintenance, or training purposes (other than detailed manufacturing or process data);
(6)  Corrections or changes to technical data furnished to the contractor by the Government;
(7)  Publicly available or have been released or disclosed by the contractor or subcontractor without restrictions on further use, release or disclosure other than a release or disclosure resulting from the sale, transfer, or other assignment of interest in the software to another party or the sale or transfer of some or all of a business entity or its assets to another party;
(8)  Data in which the Government has obtained unlimited rights under another Government contract or as a result of negotiations; or
(9)  Data furnished to the Government, under a Government contract or subcontract thereunder, with—
(i)  Government purpose license rights or limited rights and the restrictive condition(s) has/have expired; or
(ii)  Government purpose rights and the contractor's exclusive right to use such data for commercial purposes has expired.
(b) Government purpose rights .
(1)  The Government obtains government purpose rights in technical data—
(i)  That pertain to items, components, or processes developed with mixed funding except when the Government is entitled to unlimited rights as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(4) through (9) of this subsection; or
(ii)  Created with mixed funding in the performance of a contract that does not require the development, manufacture, construction, or production of items, components, or processes.
(2)  The period during which government purpose rights are effective is negotiable.  The clause at 252.227-7013 provides a nominal five-year period.  Either party may request a different period.  Changes to the government purpose rights period may be made at any time prior to delivery of the technical data without consideration from either party.  Longer periods should be negotiated when a five-year period does not provide sufficient time to apply the data for commercial purposes or when necessary to recognize subcontractors' interests in the data.
(3)  The government purpose rights period commences upon execution of the contract, subcontract, letter contract (or similar contractual instrument), contract modification, or option exercise that required the development.  Upon expiration of the Government rights period, the Government has unlimited rights in the data including the right to authorize others to use the data for commercial purposes.
(4)  During the government purpose rights period, the Government may not use, or authorize other persons to use, technical data marked with government purpose rights legends for commercial purposes.  The Government shall not release or disclose data in which it has government purpose rights to any person, or authorize others to do so, unless—
(i)  Prior to release or disclosure, the intended recipient is subject to the use and non-disclosure agreement at 227.7103-7 ; or
(ii)  The intended recipient is a Government contractor receiving access to the data for performance of a Government contract that contains the clause at 252.227-7025 , Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends.
(5)  When technical data marked with government purpose rights legends will be released or disclosed to a Government contractor performing a contract that does not include the clause at 252.227-7025 , the contract may be modified, prior to release or disclosure, to include that clause in lieu of requiring the contractor to complete a use and non-disclosure agreement.
(6)  Contracting activities shall establish procedures to assure that technical data marked with government purpose rights legends are released or disclosed, including a release or disclosure through a Government solicitation, only to persons subject to the use and non-disclosure restrictions.  Public announcements in the Commerce Business Daily or other publications must provide notice of the use and non-disclosure requirements.  Class use and non-disclosure agreements (e.g., agreements covering all solicitations received by the XYZ company within a reasonable period) are authorized and may be obtained at any time prior to release or disclosure of the government purpose rights data.  Documents transmitting government purpose rights data to persons under class agreements shall identify the technical data subject to government purpose rights and the class agreement under which such data are provided.
(c) Limited rights .
(1)  The Government obtains limited rights in technical data—
(i)  That pertain to items, components, or processes developed exclusively at private expense except when the Government is entitled to unlimited rights as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(4) through (9) of this subsection; or
(ii)  Created exclusively at private expense in the performance of a contract that does not require the development, manufacture, construction, or production of items, components, or processes.
(2)  Data in which the Government has limited rights may not be used, released, or disclosed outside the Government without the permission of the contractor asserting the restriction except for a use, release, or disclosure that is—
(i)  Necessary for emergency repair and overhaul;
(ii)  To a covered Government support contractor; or
(iii)  To a foreign government, other than detailed manufacturing or process data, when use, release, or disclosure is in the interest of the United States and is required for evaluational or informational purposes.
(3)  The person asserting limited rights must be notified of the Government's intent to release, disclose, or authorize others to use such data prior to release or disclosure of the data except notification of an intended release, disclosure, or use for emergency repair or overhaul which shall be made as soon as practicable.
(4)  When the person asserting limited rights permits the Government to release, disclose, or have others use the data subject to restrictions on further use, release, or disclosure, or for a release under paragraph (c)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this subsection, the intended recipient must complete the use and non-disclosure agreement at 227.7103-7 , or receive the data for performance of a Government contract that contains the clause at 252.227-7025 , Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends, prior to release or disclosure of the limited rights data.
(d) Specifically negotiated license rights.
(1)  Negotiate specific licenses when the parties agree to modify the standard license rights granted to the Government or when the Government wants to obtain rights in data in which it does not have rights.  When negotiating to obtain, relinquish, or increase the Government's rights in technical data, consider the acquisition strategy for the item, component, or process, including logistics support and other factors which may have relevance for a particular procurement.  The Government may accept lesser rights when it has unlimited or government purpose rights in data but may not accept less than limited rights in such data.  The negotiated license rights must stipulate what rights the Government has to release or disclose the data to other persons or to authorize others to use the data.  Identify all negotiated rights in a license agreement made part of the contract.
(2)  When the Government needs additional rights in data acquired with government purpose or limited rights, the contracting officer must negotiate with the contractor to determine whether there are acceptable terms for transferring such rights.  Generally, such negotiations should be conducted only when there is a need to disclose the data outside the Government or if the additional rights are required for competitive reprocurement and the anticipated savings expected to be obtained through competition are estimated to exceed the acquisition cost of the additional rights.  Prior to negotiating for additional rights in limited rights data, consider alternatives such as—
(i)  Using performance specifications and form, fit, and function data to acquire or develop functionally equivalent items, components, or processes;
(ii)  Obtaining a contractor's contractual commitment to qualify additional sources and maintain adequate competition among the sources; or
(iii)  Reverse engineering, or providing items from Government inventories to contractors who request the items to facilitate the development of equivalent items through reverse engineering.","[""The standard license rights that a licensor grants to the Government are unlimited rights, government purpose rights, or limited rights.

This requirement does not apply to restrictions based solely on copyright. The notification and identification must be submitted as an attachment to the offer. If an offeror fails to submit the attachment or fails to complete the attachment in accordance with the requirements of the solicitation provision, such failure shall constitute a minor informality. Provide offerors an opportunity to remedy a minor informality in accordance with the procedures at FAR 14.405 or 15.306. An offeror's failure to correct the informality within the time prescribed by the contracting officer shall render the offer ineligible for award.

Subsequent to contract award, the clause at 252.227-7013 , Rights in Technical Data–Noncommercial Items, permits the contractor to make additional assertions under certain conditions. The additional assertions must be made in accordance with the procedures and in the format prescribed by that clause.
(4) Neither the pre- or post-award assertions made by the contractor, nor the fact that certain assertions are identified in the attachment to the contract, determine the respective rights of the parties. As provided at 227.7103-13 , the Government has the right to review, verify, challenge and validate restrictive markings.
(5) Information provided by offerors in response to the solicitation provision may be used in the source selection process to evaluate the impact on evaluation factors that may be created by restrictions on the Government's ability to use or disclose technical data. However, offerors shall not be prohibited from offering products for which the offeror is entitled to provide the Government limited rights in the technical data pertaining to such products and offerors shall not be required, either as a condition of being responsive to a solicitation or as a condition for award, to sell or otherwise relinquish any greater rights in technical data when the offeror is entitled to provide the technical data with limited rights.

(2) Requires a contractor to deliver, furnish, or otherwise provide to the Government any technical data in which the Government has previously obtained rights with the Government's pre-existing rights in that data unless the parties have agreed otherwise or restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose the data have expired. When restrictions are still applicable, the contractor is permitted to mark the data with the appropriate restrictive legend for which the data qualified.
(c) Unmarked technical data .

To the extent practicable, if a contractor has requested permission (see paragraph (c)(2) of this subsection) to correct an inadvertent omission of markings, do not release or disclose the technical data pending evaluation of the request.
(2) A contractor may request permission to have appropriate legends placed on unmarked technical data at its expense. The request must be received by the contracting officer within six months following the furnishing or delivery of such data, or any extension of that time approved by the contracting officer.

227.7103-13,"Government right to review, verify, challenge, and validate asserted restrictions.","(a) General . An offeror's assertion(s) of restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, or disclose technical data do not, by themselves, determine the extent of the Government's rights in the technical data. Under 10 U.S.C. 3782 Government has the right to challenge asserted restrictions when there are reasonable grounds to question the validity of the assertion and continued adherence to the assertion would make it impractical to later procure competitively the item to which the data pertain.
(b) Pre-award considerations . The challenge procedures required by 10 U.S.C. 3782 could significantly delay awards under competitive procurements. Therefore, avoid challenging asserted restrictions prior to a competitive contract award unless resolution of the assertion is essential for successful completion of the procurement.
(c) Challenge considerations and presumption .
(1) Requirements to initiate a challenge. Contracting officers shall have reasonable grounds to challenge the validity of an asserted restriction. Before issuing a challenge to an asserted restriction, carefully consider all available information pertaining to the assertion.
(2) Commercial items–presumption regarding development exclusively at private expense. 10 U.S.C. 3772(a)(1) and 3784 establish a presumption and procedures regarding validation of asserted restrictions for technical data related to commercial items on the basis of development exclusively at private expense. Contracting officers shall presume that a commercial item was developed exclusively at private expense whether or not a contractor or subcontractor submits a justification in response to a challenge notice. The contracting officer shall not challenge a contractor's assertion that a commercial item was developed exclusively at private expense unless the Government can specifically state the reasonable grounds to question the validity of the assertion. The challenge notice shall include sufficient information to reasonably demonstrate that the commercial item was not developed exclusively at private expense. In order to sustain the challenge, the contracting officer shall provide information demonstrating that the commercial item was not developed exclusively at private expense. The challenge notice and all related correspondence shall be subject to handling procedures for classified information and controlled unclassified information. A contractor's or subcontractor's failure to respond to the challenge notice cannot be the sole basis for issuing a final decision denying the validity of an asserted restriction.
(d) Challenge and validation . All challenges must be made in accordance with the provisions of the clause at 252.227-7037 , Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data.
(1) Challenge period. Asserted restrictions should be reviewed before acceptance of technical data deliverable under the contract. Assertions must be challenged within three years after final payment under the contract or three years after delivery of the data, whichever is later. However, restrictive markings may be challenged at any time if the technical data—
(i) Are publicly available without restrictions;
(ii) Have been provided to the United States without restriction; or
(iii) Have been otherwise made available without restriction other than a release or disclosure resulting from the sale, transfer, or other assignment of interest in the technical data to another party or the sale or transfer of some or all of a business entity or its assets to another party.
(2) Pre-challenge requests for information.
(i) After consideration of the situations described in paragraph (d)(3) of this subsection, contracting officers may request the person asserting a restriction to furnish a written explanation of the facts and supporting documentation for the assertion in sufficient detail to enable the contracting officer to ascertain the basis of the restrictive markings. Additional supporting documentation may be requested when the explanation provided by the person making the assertion does not, in the contracting officer's opinion, establish the validity of the assertion.
(ii) If the person asserting the restriction fails to respond to the contracting officer's request for information or additional supporting documentation, or if the information submitted or any other available information pertaining to the validity of a restrictive marking does not justify the asserted restriction, a challenge should be considered.
(3) Transacting matters directly with subcontractors . The clause at 252.227-7037 obtains the contractor's agreement that the Government may transact matters under the clause directly with a subcontractor, at any tier, without creating or implying privity of contract. Contracting officers should permit a subcontractor or supplier to transact challenge and validation matters directly with the Government when—
(i) A subcontractor's or supplier's business interests in its technical data would be compromised if the data were disclosed to a higher tier contractor;
(ii) There is reason to believe that the contractor will not respond in a timely manner to a challenge and an untimely response would jeopardize a subcontractor's or supplier's right to assert restrictions; or
(iii) Requested to do so by a subcontractor or supplier.
(4) Challenge notice . The contracting officer shall not issue a challenge notice unless there are reasonable grounds to question the validity of an assertion. For commercial items, also see paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The contracting officer may challenge an assertion whether or not supporting documentation was requested under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.  Challenge notices must be in writing and issued to the contractor or, after consideration of the situations described in paragraph (d)(3) of this subsection, the person asserting the restriction. The challenge notice must include the information in paragraph (e) of the clause at 252.227-7037 .
(5) Extension of response time . The contracting officer, at his or her discretion, may extend the time for response contained in a challenge notice, as appropriate, if the contractor submits a timely written request showing the need for additional time to prepare a response.
(6) Contracting officer's final decision. Contracting officers must issue a final decision for each challenged assertion, whether or not the assertion has been justified.
(i) A contracting officer's final decision that an assertion is not justified must be issued as soon as practicable following the failure of the person asserting the restriction to respond to the contracting officer's challenge within 60 days, or any extension to that time granted by the contracting officer.
(ii) A contracting officer who, following a challenge and response by the person asserting the restriction, determines that an asserted restriction is justified, shall issue a final decision sustaining the validity of the asserted restriction. If the asserted restriction was made subsequent to submission of the contractor's offer, add the asserted restriction to the contract attachment.
(iii) A contracting officer who determines that the validity of an asserted restriction has not been justified shall issue a contracting officer's final decision within the time frames prescribed in 252.227-7037 . As provided in paragraph (g) of that clause, the Government is obligated to continue to respect the asserted restrictions through final disposition of any appeal unless the agency head notifies the person asserting the restriction that urgent or compelling circumstances do not permit the Government to continue to respect the asserted restriction.
(7) Multiple challenges to an asserted restriction . When more than one contracting officer challenges an asserted restriction, the contracting officer who made the earliest challenge is responsible for coordinating the Government challenges. That contracting officer shall consult with all other contracting officers making challenges, verify that all challenges apply to the same asserted restriction and, after consulting with the contractor, subcontractor, or supplier asserting the restriction, issue a schedule that provides that person a reasonable opportunity to respond to each challenge.
(8) Validation . Only a contracting officer's final decision, or actions of an agency board of contract appeals or a court of competent jurisdiction, that sustain the validity of an asserted restriction constitute validation of the asserted restriction.","[""(a) General .

(1) Provides for the establishment of remedies applicable to technical data found to be incomplete, inadequate, or not to satisfy the requirements of the contract concerning such data; and
(2) Authorizes agency heads to withhold payments (or exercise such other remedies an agency head considers appropriate) during any period if the contractor does not meet the requirements of the contract pertaining to the delivery of technical data.
(b) Conformity and acceptance. (1) Solicitations and contracts requiring the delivery of technical data shall specify the requirements the data must satisfy to be acceptable. Contracting officers, or their authorized representatives, are responsible for determining whether technical data tendered for acceptance conform to the contractual requirements.
(2) The clause at 252.227-7030 , Technical Data - Withholding of Payment, provides for withholding up to 10 percent of the contract price pending correction or replacement of the nonconforming technical data or negotiation of an equitable reduction in contract price. The amount subject to withholding may be expressed as a fixed dollar amount or as a percentage of the contract price. In either case, the amount shall be determined giving consideration to the relative value and importance of the data. For example -
(i) When the sole purpose of a contract is to produce the data, the relative value of that data may be considerably higher than the value of data produced under a contract where the production of the data is a secondary objective; or
(ii) When the Government will maintain or repair items, repair and maintenance data may have a considerably higher relative value than data that merely describe the item or provide performance characteristics.

227.7203-5,Government rights.,"The standard license rights in computer software that a licensor grants to the Government are unlimited rights, government purpose rights, or restricted rights.  The standard license in computer software documentation conveys unlimited rights.  Those rights are defined in the clause at 252.227-7014 , Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation.  In unusual situations, the standard rights may not satisfy the Government's needs or the Government may be willing to accept lesser rights in return for other consideration.  In those cases, a special license may be negotiated.  However, the licensor is not obligated to provide the Government greater rights and the contracting officer is not required to accept lesser rights than the rights provided in the standard grant of license.  The situations under which a particular grant of license applies are enumerated in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this subsection.
(a) Unlimited rights. The Government obtains an unlimited rights license in—
(1)  Computer software developed exclusively with Government funds;
(2)  Computer software documentation required to be delivered under a Government contract;
(3)  Corrections or changes to computer software or computer software documentation furnished to the contractor by the Government;
(4)  Computer software or computer software documentation that is otherwise publicly available or has been released or disclosed by the contractor or subcontractor without restrictions on further use, release or disclosure other than a release or disclosure resulting from the sale, transfer, or other assignment of interest in the software to another party or the sale or transfer of some or all of a business entity or its assets to another party;
(5)  Computer software or computer software documentation obtained with unlimited rights under another Government contract or as a result of negotiations; or
(6)  Computer software or computer software documentation furnished to the Government, under a Government contract or subcontract with—
(i)  Restricted rights in computer software, limited rights in technical data, or government purpose license rights and the restrictive conditions have expired; or
(ii)  Government purpose rights and the contractor's exclusive right to use such software or documentation for commercial purposes has expired.
(b) Government purpose rights.
(1)  Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the Government obtains government purpose rights in computer software developed with mixed funding.
(2)  The period during which government purpose rights are effective is negotiable.  The clause at 252.227-7014 provides a nominal five-year period.  Either party may request a different period.  Changes to the government purpose rights period may be made at any time prior to delivery of the software without consideration from either party.  Longer periods should be negotiated when a five-year period does not provide sufficient time to commercialize the software or, for software developed by subcontractors, when necessary to recognize the subcontractors' interests in the software.
(3)  The government purpose rights period commences upon execution of the contract, subcontract, letter contract (or similar contractual instrument), contract modification, or option exercise that required development of the computer software.  Upon expiration of the government purpose rights period, the Government has unlimited rights in the software including the right to authorize others to use the data for commercial purposes.
(4)  During the government purpose rights period, the Government may not use, or authorize other persons to use, computer software marked with government purpose rights legends for commercial purposes.  The Government shall not release or disclose, or authorize others to release or disclose, computer software in which it has government purpose rights to any person unless—
(i)  Prior to release or disclosure, the intended recipient is subject to the use and non-disclosure agreement at 227.7103-7 ; or
(ii)  The intended recipient is a Government contractor receiving access to the software for performance of a Government contract that contains the clause at 252.227-7025 , Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends.
(5)  When computer software marked with government purpose rights legends will be released or disclosed to a Government contractor performing a contract that does not include the clause at 252.227-7025 , the contract may be modified, prior to release or disclosure, to include such clause in lieu of requiring the contractor to complete a use and non-disclosure agreement.
(6)  Contracting activities shall establish procedures to assure that computer software or computer software documentation marked with government purpose rights legends are released or disclosed, including a release or disclosure through a Government solicitation, only to persons subject to the use and non-disclosure restrictions.  Public announcements in the Commerce Business Daily or other publications must provide notice of the use and non-disclosure requirements.  Class use and non-disclosure agreements (e.g., agreements covering all solicitations received by the XYZ company within a reasonable period) are authorized and may be obtained at any time prior to release or disclosure of the government purpose rights software or documentation.  Documents transmitting government purpose rights software or documentation to persons under class agreements shall identify the specific software or documentation subject to government purpose rights and the class agreement under which such software or documentation are provided.
(c) Restricted rights .
(1)  The Government obtains restricted rights in noncommercial computer software, required to be delivered or otherwise provided to the Government under a contract, that was developed exclusively at private expense.
(2)  Contractors are not required to provide the Government additional rights in computer software delivered or otherwise provided to the Government with restricted rights.  When the Government has a need for additional rights, the Government must negotiate with the contractor to determine if there are acceptable terms for transferring such rights.  List or describe all software in which the contractor has granted the Government additional rights in a license agreement made part of the contract (see paragraph (d) of this subsection).  The license shall enumerate the specific additional rights granted to the Government.
(d) Specifically negotiated license rights .  Negotiate specific licenses when the parties agree to modify the standard license rights granted to the Government or when the Government wants to obtain rights in computer software in which it does not have rights.  When negotiating to obtain, relinquish, or increase the Government's rights in computer software, consider the planned software maintenance philosophy, anticipated time or user sharing requirements, and other factors which may have relevance for a particular procurement.  If negotiating to relinquish rights in computer software documentation, consider the administrative burden associated with protecting documentation subject to restrictions from unauthorized release or disclosure.  The negotiated license rights must stipulate the rights granted the Government to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose the software or documentation and the extent to which the Government may authorize others to do so.  Identify all negotiated rights in a license agreement made part of the contract.
(e) Rights in derivative computer software or computer software documentation .  The clause at 252.227-7014 protects the Government's rights in computer software, computer software documentation, or portions thereof that the contractor subsequently uses to prepare derivative software or subsequently embeds or includes in other software or documentation.  The Government retains the rights it obtained under the development contract in the unmodified portions of the derivative software or documentation.","[""The standard license rights in computer software that a licensor grants to the Government are unlimited rights, government purpose rights, or restricted rights.

227.7203-10,Contractor identification and marking of computer software or computer software documentation to be furnished with restrictive markings.,"(a) Identification requirements .
(1)  The solicitation provision at 252.227-7017 , Identification and Assertion of Use, Release, or Disclosure Restrictions, requires offerors to identify, prior to contract award, any computer software or computer software documentation that an offeror asserts should be provided to the Government with restrictions on use, modification, reproduction, release, or disclosure.  This requirement does not apply to restrictions based solely on copyright.  The notification and identification must be submitted as an attachment to the offer.  If an offeror fails to submit the attachment or fails to complete the attachment in accordance with the requirements of the solicitation provision, such failure shall constitute a minor informality.  Provide offerors an opportunity to remedy a minor informality in accordance with the procedures at FAR 14.405 or 15.306(a).  An offeror's failure to correct an informality within the time prescribed by the contracting officer shall render the offer ineligible for award.
(2)  The procedures for correcting minor informalities shall not be used to obtain information regarding asserted restrictions or an offeror's suggested asserted rights category.  Questions regarding the justification for an asserted restriction or asserted rights category must be pursued in accordance with the procedures at 227.7203-13 .
(3)  The restrictions asserted by a successful offeror shall be attached to its contract unless, in accordance with the procedures at 227.7203-13 , the parties have agreed that an asserted restriction is not justified.  The contract attachment shall provide the same information regarding identification of the computer software or computer software documentation, the asserted rights category, the basis for the assertion, and the name of the person asserting the restrictions as required by paragraph (d) of the solicitation provision at 252.227-7017 .  Subsequent to contract award, the clause at 252.227-7014 , Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation, permits a contractor to make additional assertions under certain conditions.  The additional assertions must be made in accordance with the procedures and in the format prescribed by that clause.
(4)  Neither the pre- or post-award assertions made by the contractor nor the fact that certain assertions are identified in the attachment to the contract, determine the respective rights of the parties.  As provided at 227.7203-13 , the Government has the right to review, verify, challenge and validate restrictive markings.
(5)  Information provided by offerors in response to the solicitation provision at 252.227-7017 may be used in the source selection process to evaluate the impact on evaluation factors that may be created by restrictions on the Government's ability to use or disclose computer software or computer software documentation.
(b) Contractor marking requirements .  The clause at 252.227-7014 , Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation—
(1)  Requires a contractor who desires to restrict the Government's rights in computer software or computer software documentation to place restrictive markings on the software or documentation, provides instructions for the placement of the restrictive markings, and authorizes the use of certain restrictive markings.  When it is anticipated that the software will or may be used in combat or situations which simulate combat conditions, do not permit contractors to insert instructions into computer programs that interfere with or delay operation of the software to display a restrictive rights legend or other license notice; and
(2)  Requires a contractor to deliver, furnish, or otherwise provide to the Government any computer software or computer software documentation in which the Government has previously obtained rights with the Government's pre-existing rights in that software or documentation unless the parties have agreed otherwise or restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, or disclose the software or documentation have expired.  When restrictions are still applicable, the contractor is permitted to mark the software or documentation with the appropriate restrictive legend.
(c) Unmarked computer software or computer software documentation .
(1)  Computer software or computer software documentation delivered or otherwise provided under a contract without restrictive markings shall be presumed to have been delivered with unlimited rights and may be released or disclosed without restriction.  To the extent practicable, if a contractor has requested permission (see paragraph (c)(2) of this subsection) to correct an inadvertent omission of markings, do not release or disclose the software or documentation pending evaluation of the request.
(2)  A contractor may request permission to have appropriate legends placed on unmarked computer software or computer software documentation at its expense.  The request must be received by the contracting officer within six months following the furnishing or delivery of such software or documentation, or any extension of that time approved by the contracting officer.  The person making the request must—
(i)  Identify the software or documentation that should have been marked;
(ii)  Demonstrate that the omission of the marking was inadvertent, the proposed marking is justified and conforms with the requirements for the marking of computer software or computer software documentation contained in the clause at 252.227-7014 ; and
(iii)  Acknowledge, in writing, that the Government has no liability with respect to any disclosure, reproduction, or use of the software or documentation made prior to the addition of the marking or resulting from the omission of the marking.

All other markings are nonconforming markings.  An authorized marking that is not in the form, or differs in substance, from the marking requirements in the clause at 252.227-7014 is also a nonconforming marking.
(2)  The correction of nonconforming markings on computer software is not subject to 252.227-7019 , Validation of Asserted Restrictions—Computer Software, and the correction of nonconforming markings on computer software documentation (technical data) is not subject to 252.227-7037 , Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data.  To the extent practicable, the contracting officer should return computer software or computer software documentation bearing nonconforming markings to the person who has placed the nonconforming markings on the software or documentation to provide that person an opportunity to correct or strike the nonconforming markings at that person's expense.  If that person fails to correct the nonconformity and return the corrected software or documentation within 60 days following the person's receipt of the software or documentation, the contracting officer may correct or strike the nonconformity at that person's expense.  When it is impracticable to return computer software or computer software documentation for correction, contracting officers may unilaterally correct any nonconforming markings at Government expense.  Prior to correction, the software or documentation may be used in accordance with the proper restrictive marking.
(b) Unjustified markings .
(1)  An unjustified marking is an authorized marking that does not depict accurately restrictions applicable to the Government's use, modification, reproduction, release, or disclosure of the marked computer software or computer software documentation.  For example, a restricted rights legend placed on computer software developed under a Government contract either exclusively at Government expense or with mixed funding (situations under which the Government obtains unlimited or government purpose rights) is an unjustified marking.
(2)  Contracting officers have the right to review and challenge the validity of unjustified markings.  However, at any time during performance of a contract and notwithstanding existence of a challenge, the contracting officer and the person who has asserted a restrictive marking may agree that the restrictive marking is not justified.  Upon such agreement, the contracting officer may, at his or her election, either—
(i)  Strike or correct the unjustified marking at that person's expense; or
(ii)  Return the computer software or computer software documentation to the person asserting the restriction for correction at that person's expense.

An offeror's or contractor's assertion(s) of restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, or disclose computer software or computer software documentation do not, by themselves, determine the extent of the Government's rights in such software or documentation. The Government may require an offeror or contractor to submit sufficient information to permit an evaluation of a particular asserted restriction and may challenge asserted restrictions when there are reasonable grounds to believe that an assertion is not valid.
(b) Requests for information . Contracting officers should have a reason to suspect that an asserted restriction might not be correct prior to requesting information. When requesting information, provide the offeror or contractor the reason(s) for suspecting that an asserted restriction might not be correct. A need for additional license rights is not, by itself, a sufficient basis for requesting information concerning an asserted restriction. Follow the procedures at 227.7203-5 (d) when additional license rights are needed but there is no basis to suspect that an asserted restriction might not be valid.
(c) Transacting matters directly with subcontractors . The clause at 252.227-7019 , Validation of Asserted Restrictions—Computer Software, obtains the contractor's agreement that the Government may transact matters under the clause directly with a subcontractor or supplier, at any tier, without creating or implying privity of contract. Contracting officers should permit a subcontractor or supplier to transact challenge and validation matters directly with the Government when—
(1) A subcontractor's or supplier's business interests in its technical data would be compromised if the data were disclosed to a higher tier contractor;
(2) There is reason to believe that the contractor will not respond in a timely manner to a challenge and an untimely response would jeopardize a subcontractor's or supplier's right to assert restrictions; or
(3) Requested to do so by a subcontractor or supplier.
(d) Challenging asserted restrictions .
(1) Pre-award considerations . The challenge procedures in the clause at 252.227-7019 could significantly delay competitive procurements. Therefore, avoid challenging asserted restrictions prior to a competitive contract award unless resolution of the assertion is essential for successful completion of the procurement.
(2) Computer software documentation . Computer software documentation is technical data. Challenges to asserted restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose computer software documentation must be made in accordance with the clause at 252.227-7037 , Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data, and the guidance at 227.7103-13 . The procedures in the clause at 252.227-7037 implement requirements contained in 10 U.S.C. 3781-3786 . Resolution of questions regarding the validity of asserted restrictions using the process described at 227.7103-12 (b)(2) is strongly encouraged.
(3) Computer software.
(i) Asserted restrictions should be reviewed before acceptance of the computer software deliverable under a contract. The Government's right to challenge an assertion expires three years after final payment under the contract or three years after delivery of the software, whichever is later. Those limitations on the Government's challenge rights do not apply to software that is publicly available, has been furnished to the Government without restrictions, or has been otherwise made available without restrictions.
(ii) Contracting officers must have reasonable grounds to challenge the current validity of an asserted restriction. Before challenging an asserted restriction, carefully consider all available information pertaining to the asserted restrictions. Resolution of questions regarding the validity of asserted restrictions using the process described at 227.7203-12 (b)(2) is strongly encouraged. After consideration of the situations described in paragraph (c) of this subsection, contracting officers may request the person asserting a restriction to furnish a written explanation of the facts and supporting documentation for the assertion in sufficient detail to enable the contracting officer to determine the validity of the assertion. Additional supporting documentation may be requested when the explanation provided by that person does not, in the contracting officer's opinion, establish the validity of the assertion.
(iii) Assertions may be challenged whether or not supporting documentation was requested. Challenges must be in writing and issued to the person asserting the restriction.
(4) Extension of response time. The contracting officer, at his or her discretion, may extend the time for response contained in a challenge, as appropriate, if the contractor submits a timely written request showing the need for additional time to prepare a response.
(e) Validating or denying asserted restrictions .
(1) Contracting officers must promptly issue a final decision denying or sustaining the validity of each challenged assertion unless the parties have agreed on the disposition of the assertion. When a final decision denying the validity of an asserted restriction is made following a timely response to a challenge, the Government is obligated to continue to respect the asserted restrictions through final disposition of any appeal unless the agency head notifies the person asserting the restriction that urgent or compelling circumstances do not permit the Government to continue to respect the asserted restriction. See 252.227-7019 (g) for restrictions applicable following a determination of urgent and compelling circumstances.
(2) Only a contracting officer's final decision, or actions of an agency Board of Contract Appeals or a court of competent jurisdiction, that sustain the validity of an asserted restriction constitute validation of the restriction.
(f) Multiple challenges to an asserted restriction. When more than one contracting officer challenges an asserted restriction, the contracting officer who made the earliest challenge is responsible for coordinating the Government challenges.

231.205-70,External restructuring costs.,"(a) Scope. This subsection—
(1)  Prescribes policies and procedures for allowing contractor external restructuring costs when savings would result for DoD; and
(2) Implements 10 U.S.C. 3761 .
(b) Definitions. As used in this subsection:
(1)  “Business combination” means a transaction whereby assets or operations of two or more companies not previously under common ownership or control are combined, whether by merger, acquisition, or sale/purchase of assets.
(2)  “External restructuring activities” means restructuring activities occurring after a business combination that affect the operations of companies not previously under common ownership or control.  They do not include restructuring activities occurring after a business combination that affect the operations of only one of the companies not previously under common ownership or control, or, when there has been no business combination, restructuring activities undertaken within one company.  External restructuring activities are a direct outgrowth of a business combination.  They normally will be initiated within 3 years of the business combination.
(3)  “Restructuring activities” means nonroutine, nonrecurring, or extraordinary activities to combine facilities, operations, or workforce, in order to eliminate redundant capabilities, improve future operations, and reduce overall costs.  Restructuring activities do not include routine or ongoing repositionings and redeployments of a contractor’s productive facilities or workforce (e.g., normal plant rearrangement or employee relocation), nor do they include other routine or ordinary activities charged as indirect costs that would otherwise have been incurred (e.g., planning and analysis, contract administration and oversight, or recurring financial and administrative support).
(4)  “Restructuring costs” means the costs, including both direct and indirect, of restructuring activities.  Restructuring costs that may be allowed include, but are not limited to, severance pay for employees, early retirement incentive payments for employees, employee retraining costs, relocation expense for retained employees, and relocation and rearrangement of plant and equipment.  For purposes of this definition, if restructuring costs associated with external restructuring activities allocated to DoD contracts are less than $2.5 million, the costs shall not be subject to the audit, review, and determination requirements of paragraph (c)(4) of this subsection; instead, the normal rules for determining cost allowability in accordance with FAR Part 31 shall apply.
(5)  “Restructuring savings” means cost reductions, including both direct and indirect cost reductions, that result from restructuring activities.  Reassignments of cost to future periods are not restructuring savings.
(c) Limitations on cost allowability. Restructuring costs associated with external restructuring activities shall not be allowed unless—
(1)  Such costs are allowable in accordance with FAR Part 31 and DFARS Part 231;
(2)  An audit of projected restructuring costs and restructuring savings is performed;
(3)  The cognizant administrative contracting officer (ACO) reviews the audit report and the projected costs and projected savings, and negotiates an advance agreement in accordance with paragraph (d) of this subsection; and
(4)(i)  The official designated in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this subsection determines in writing that the audited projected savings, on a present value basis, for DoD resulting from the restructuring will exceed either—
(A)  The costs allowed by a factor of at least two to one; or
(B)  The costs allowed, and the business combination will result in the preservation of a critical capability that might otherwise be lost to DoD.
(ii)(A)  If the amount of restructuring costs is expected to exceed $25 million over a 5-year period, the designated official is the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) or the Principal Deputy.  This authority may not be delegated below the level of an Assistant Secretary of Defense.
(B)  For all other cases, the designated official is the Director of the Defense Contract Management Agency.  The Director may not delegate this authority.
(d) Procedures and ACO responsibilities. As soon as it is known that the contractor will incur restructuring costs for external restructuring activities, the cognizant ACO shall follow the procedures at PGI 231.205-70 (d).
(e) Information needed to obtain a determination.
(1)  The novation agreement (if one is required).
(2)  The contractor’s restructuring proposal.
(3)  The proposed advance agreement.
(4)  The audit report.
(5)  Any other pertinent information.
(6)  The cognizant ACO’s recommendation for a determination.  This recommendation must clearly indicate one of the following, consistent with paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this subsection:
(i)  The audited projected savings for DoD will exceed the costs allowed by a factor of at least two to one on a present value basis.
(ii)  The business combination will result in the preservation of a critical capability that might otherwise be lost to DoD, and the audited projected savings for DoD will exceed the costs allowed on a present value basis.
(f) Contracting officer responsibilities.
(1)  The contracting officer, in consultation with the cognizant ACO, should consider including a repricing clause in noncompetitive fixed-price contracts that are negotiated during the period between—
(i)  The time a business combination is announced; and
(ii)  The time the contractor’s forward pricing rates are adjusted to reflect the impact of restructuring.
(2)  The decision to use a repricing clause will depend upon the particular circumstances involved, including—
(i)  When the restructuring will take place;
(ii)  When restructuring savings will begin to be realized;
(iii)  The contract performance period;
(iv)  Whether the contracting parties are able to make a reasonable estimate of the impact of restructuring on the contract; and
(v)  The size of the potential dollar impact of restructuring on the contract.
(3)  If the contracting officer decides to use a repricing clause, the clause must provide for a downward-only price adjustment to ensure that DoD receives its appropriate share of restructuring net savings.","['(a) Scope.

Covered services are—
(1) Operation, maintenance, and support of facilities and installations;
(2) Maintenance or modification of aircraft, ships, vehicles, and other highly complex military equipment;
(3) Specialized training requiring high quality instructor skills (e.g., training for pilots and aircrew members or foreign language training);
(4) Base services (e.g., ground maintenance, in-plane refueling, bus transportation, and refuse collection and disposal); and
(5) Environmental remediation services for—

(ii) A military installation being closed or realigned under a base closure law as defined in 10 U.S.C. 2667(h)(2); or
(iii) A site formerly used by DoD (10 U.S.C. 3531(b) ).
(b) The head of the agency must be guided by the following principles when entering into a multiyear contract for services:
(1) The portion of the cost of any plant or equipment amortized as a cost of contract performance should not exceed the ratio between the period of contract performance and the anticipated useful commercial life of the plant or equipment. As used in this section, ""useful commercial life"" means the commercial utility of the facilities rather than the physical life, with due consideration given to such factors as the location, specialized nature, and obsolescence of the facilities.
(2) Consider the desirability of obtaining an option to extend the term of the contract for a reasonable period not to exceed 3 years at prices that do not include charges for plant, equipment, or other nonrecurring costs already amortized.
(3) Consider the desirability of reserving the right to take title, under the appropriate circumstances, to the plant or equipment upon payment of the unamortized portion of the cost (10 U.S.C. 3531(c) ).
(c) Before entering into a multiyear contract for services, the head of the agency must make a written determination that—
(1) There will be a continuing requirement for the services consistent with current plans for the proposed contract period;
(2) Furnishing the services will require—
(i) A substantial initial investment in plant or equipment; or
(ii) The incurrence of substantial contingent liabilities for the assembly, training, or transportation of a specialized work force; and

(1) The Office of the Principal Director, Defense Pricing and Contracting (DPC), using the procedures at , will organize teams
of reviewers and facilitate peer reviews for solicitations and contracts,
as follows:
(i) DPC
will conduct the 
            preaward peer reviews
for competitive procurements prior to the in three
phases of the acquisition (see (a)) for
all procurements
with an estimated value of $1 billion or more under major defense acquisition programs
for which the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment
(USD(A&S)) is the milestone decision authority or USD(A&S)
designates as requiring a peer review regardless of value. DoD components
may request DPC-led peer reviews for acquisitions valued below the
$1 billion threshold. DPC will conduct these reviews upon approval
by the Director, Defense Pricing and Contracting (Contract Policy).]
(ii) DPC
will conduct the 
            preaward peer reviews
for noncompetitive procurements prior to the 
            two phases 
            of the acquisition
(see (b))] for contract actions, e.g.,
new contracts, modifications to existing contracts, requests for
equitable adjustment, claims valued at $1 billion or more, or for any
other contract action USD(A&S) designates as requiring a peer
review regardless of value. DoD components may request DPC-led peer
reviews for contract actions valued below the $1 billion threshold.
DPC will conduct these reviews upon approval by the Director, Defense
Pricing and Contracting (Price, Cost and Finance).
(iii) Use the following criteria
to identify actions that are subject to peer review (see also FAR
1.108(c), Dollar thresholds):
(A) If the not-to-exceed amount
for an undefinitized contract action or an unpriced change order
exceeds the peer review threshold, then the resultant definitization
modification(s) will be subject to peer review regardless of actual
performance up to the point of definitization.
(B) For indefinite delivery
indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts that will establish pricing
terms that apply to orders, use the total maximum dollar value for
purposes of the peer review threshold. IDIQ contracts that will
not establish pricing terms in the basic contract are not subject
to peer review, but individual orders that exceed the threshold are
subject to peer review.
(C) For noncompetitive contract
actions, use the greater of the following when considering the firm
requirement for all supplies or services:
( 1 ) The approved Government
objective amount.
( 2 ) The contractor
proposed amount.
(2) To facilitate planning
for peer reviews, the military departments and defense agencies

(ii)  Includes structures, alterations, and improvements, acquired for the purpose of conducting scientific research under contracts with departments and agencies of the DoD.
(2)  “Special use allowance” means a negotiated direct or indirect allowance—
(i)  For construction or acquisition of buildings, structures, and real property, other than land; and
(ii)  Where the allowance is computed at an annual rate exceeding the rate which normally would be allowed under FAR Subpart 31.3.
(b) Policy.
(1)  Educational institutions are to furnish the facilities necessary to perform defense contracts.  FAR 31.3 governs how much the Government will reimburse the institution for the research programs.  However, in extraordinary situations, the Government may give special use allowances to an educational institution when the institution is unable to provide the capital for new laboratories or expanded facilities needed for defense contracts.
(2)  Decisions to provide a special use allowance must be made on a case-by-case basis, using the criteria in paragraph (c) of this subsection.
(c) Authorization for special use allowance. The head of a contracting activity may approve special use allowances only when all of the following conditions are met—
(1)  The research facility is essential to the performance of DoD contracts;
(2)  Existing facilities, either Government or nongovernment, cannot meet program requirements practically or effectively;
(3)  The proposed agreement for special use allowances is a sound business arrangement;
(4)  The Government's furnishing of Government-owned facilities is undesirable or impractical; and
(5)  The proposed use of the research facility is to conduct essential Government research which requires the new or expanded facilities.
(d) Application of the special use allowance.
(1)  In negotiating a special use allowance—
(i)  Compare the needs of DoD and of the institution for the research facility to determine the amount of the special use allowance;
(ii)  Consider rental costs for similar space in the area where the research facility is or will be located to establish the annual special use allowance;
(iii)  Do not include or allow—
(A)  The costs of land; or
(B)  Interest charges on capital;
(iv)  Do not include maintenance, utilities, or other operational costs;
(v)  The period of allowance generally will be—
(A)  At least ten years; or
(B)  A shorter period if the total amount to be allowed is less than the construction or acquisition cost for the research facility;
(vi)  Generally, provide for allocation of the special use allowance equitably among the Government contracts using the research facility;
(vii)  Special use allowances apply only in the years in which the Government has contracts in effect with the institution.  However, if in any given year there is a reduced level of Government research effort which results in the special use allowance being excessive compared to the Government research funding, a separate special use allowance may be negotiated for that year;
(viii)  Special use allowances may be adjusted for the period before construction is complete if the facility is partially occupied and used for Government research during that period.
(2)  A special use allowance may be based on either total or partial cost of construction or acquisition of the research facility.
(i)  When based on total cost neither the normal use allowance nor depreciation will apply—
(A)  During the special use allowance period; and
(B)  After the educational institution has recovered the total construction or acquisition cost from the Government or other users.
(ii)  When based on partial cost, normal use allowance and depreciation—
(A)  Apply to the balance of costs during the special use allowance period to the extent negotiated in the special use allowance agreement; and
(B)  Do not apply after the special use allowance period, except for normal use allowance applied to the balance.
(3)  During the special use allowance period, the research facility—
(i)  Shall be available for Government research use on a priority basis over nongovernment use; and
(ii)  Cannot be put to any significant use other than that which justified the special use allowance, unless the head of the contracting activity, who approved the special use allowance, consents.
(4)  The Government will pay only an allocable share of the special use allowance when the institution makes any substantial use of the research facility for parties other than the Government during the period when the special use allowance is in effect.
(5)  In no event shall the institution be paid more than the acquisition costs.","['(a) Definitions.

215.404-1,Proposal analysis techniques.,"(a) General .
(i)  Follow the procedures at PGI 215.404-1 for proposal analysis.
(ii)  For spare parts or support equipment, perform an analysis of—
(A)  Those line items where the proposed price exceeds by 25 percent or more the lowest price the Government has paid within the most recent 12-month period based on reasonably available data;
(B)  Those line items where a comparison of the item description and the proposed price indicates a potential for overpricing;
(C)  Significant high-dollar-value items.  If there are no obvious high-dollar-value items, include an analysis of a random sample of items; and
(D)  A random sample of the remaining low-dollar value items.  Sample size may be determined by subjective judgment, e.g., experience with the offeror and the reliability of its estimating and accounting systems.
(b) Price analysis for commercial and noncommercial items .
(i)  In the absence of adequate price competition in response to the solicitation, pricing based on market prices is the preferred method to establish a fair and reasonable price (see PGI 215.404-1 (b)(i)).
(ii) If the contracting officer determines that the information obtained through market research is insufficient to determine the reasonableness of price, the contracting officer shall consider information submitted by the offeror of recent purchase prices paid by the Government and commercial customers for the same or similar commercial items under comparable terms and conditions in establishing price reasonableness on a subsequent purchase if the contracting officer is satisfied that the prices previously paid remain a valid reference for comparison. Price reasonableness shall not be based solely on historical prices paid by the Government (see 215.403-3 (a)(1)). The contracting officer shall consider the totality of other relevant factors such as the time elapsed since the prior purchase and any differences in the quantities purchased ( 10 U.S.C. 3703(e) ).
(iii)  If the contracting officer determines that the offeror cannot provide sufficient information as described in paragraph (b)(ii) of this section to determine the reasonableness of price, the contracting officer should request the offeror to submit information on—
(A)  Prices paid for the same or similar items sold under different terms and conditions;
(B)  Prices paid for similar levels of work or effort on related products or services;
(C)  Prices paid for alternative solutions or approaches; and
(D)  Other relevant information that can serve as the basis for determining the reasonableness of price.
(iv)  If the contracting officer determines that the pricing information submitted is not sufficient to determine the reasonableness of price, the contracting officer shall request other relevant information, to include cost data.  However, no cost data may be required in any case in which there are sufficient non-Government sales of the same item to establish reasonableness of price (section 831 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (Pub. L. 112-239)).
(v) When evaluating pricing data, the contracting officer shall consider materially differing terms and conditions, quantities, and market and economic factors (see PGI 215.404-1 Proposal analysistechniques. (b)(v)). For similar items, the contracting officer shall also consider material differences between the similar item and the item being procured (see FAR 15.404-1(b)(2)(ii)(B)). Material differences are those that could reasonably be expected to influence the contracting officer's determination of price reasonableness. The contracting officer shall consider the following factors when evaluating the relevance of the information available:
(A) Market prices .
(B) Age of data .
( 1 )  Whether data is too old to be relevant depends on the industry (e.g., rapidly evolving technologies), product maturity (e.g., stable), economic factors (e.g., new sellers in the marketplace), and various other considerations.
( 2 )  A pending sale may be relevant if, in the judgement of the contracting officer, it is probable at the anticipated price, and the sale could reasonably be expected to materially influence the contracting officer’s determination of price reasonableness.  The contracting officer may consult with the cognizant administrative contracting officers (ACOs) as they may have information about pending sales.
(C) Volume and completeness of transaction data .  Data must include a sufficient number of transactions to represent the range of relevant sales to all types of customers.  The data must also include key information, such as date, quantity sold, part number, part nomenclature, sales price, and customer.  If the number of transactions is insufficient or the data is incomplete, the contracting officer shall request additional sales data to evaluate price reasonableness.  If the contractor cannot provide sufficient sales data, the contracting officer shall request other relevant information.
(D) Nature of transactions .  The nature of a sales transaction includes the information necessary to understand the transaction, such as terms and conditions, date, quantity sold, sale price, unique requirements, the type of customer (government, distributor, retail end-user, etc.), and related agreements.  It also includes warranties, key product technical specifications, maintenance agreements, and preferred customer rewards.
(vi)  The contracting officer shall consider catalog prices to be reliable when they are regularly maintained and supported by relevant sales data (including any related discounts, refunds, rebates, offsets, or other adjustments).  The contracting officer may request that the offeror support differences between the proposed price(s), catalog price(s), and relevant sales data.

215.404-71-2,Performance risk.,"(a) Description. This profit
factor addresses the contractor's degree of risk in fulfilling the
contract requirements. The factor consists of two parts:
(1) Technical - the technical uncertainties
of performance.
(2) Management/cost control - the degree
of management effort necessary -
(i) To ensure that contract requirements
are met; and
(ii) To reduce and control costs.
(b) Determination. The following
extract from the DD Form 1547 is annotated to describe the process.
(1) Assign a weight (percentage) to each
element according to its input to the total performance risk. The
total of the two weights equals 100 percent.
(2) Select a value for each element from
the list in paragraph (c) of this subsection using the evaluation
criteria in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this subsection.
(3) Compute the composite as shown in the
following example:
(4) Insert the amount from Block 20 of
the DD Form 1547. Block 20 is total contract costs, excluding facilities
capital cost of money.
(5) Multiply (3) by (4).
(c) Values: Normal and designated ranges.
(1) Standard. The standard designated
range should apply to most contracts.
(2) Technology incentive. For the
technical factor only, contracting officers may use the technology
incentive range for acquisitions that include development, production,
or application of innovative new technologies. The technology incentive
range does not apply to efforts restricted to studies, analyses,
or demonstrations that have a technical report as their primary
deliverable.
(d) Evaluation criteria for technical. (1)
Review the contract requirements and focus on the critical performance
elements in the statement of work or specifications. Factors to
consider include -
(i) Technology being applied or developed
by the contractor;
(ii) Technical complexity;
(iii) Program maturity;
(iv) Performance specifications and tolerances;
(v) Delivery schedule; and
(vi) Extent of a warranty or guarantee.
(2) Above normal conditions. (i)
The contracting officer may assign a higher than normal value in
those cases where there is a substantial technical risk. Indicators
are -
(A) Items are being manufactured using
specifications with stringent tolerance limits;
(B) The efforts require highly skilled
personnel or require the use of state-of-the-art machinery;
(C) The services and analytical efforts
are extremely important to the Government and must be performed
to exacting standards;
(D) The contractor's independent development
and investment has reduced the Government's risk or cost;
(E) The contractor has accepted an accelerated
delivery schedule to meet DoD requirements; or
(F) The contractor has assumed additional
risk through warranty provisions.
(ii) Extremely complex, vital efforts to
overcome difficult technical obstacles that require personnel with
exceptional abilities, experience, and professional credentials
may justify a value significantly above normal.
(iii) The following may justify a maximum
value -
(A) Development or initial production of
a new item, particularly if performance or quality specifications
are tight; or
(B) A high degree of development or production
concurrency.
(3) Below normal conditions. (i)
The contracting officer may assign a lower than normal value in
those cases where the technical risk is low. Indicators are -
(A) Requirements are relatively simple;
(B) Technology is not complex;
(C) Efforts do not require highly skilled
personnel;
(D) Efforts are routine;
(E) Programs are mature; or
(F) Acquisition is a follow-on effort or
a repetitive type acquisition.
(ii) The contracting officer may assign
a value significantly below normal for -
(A) Routine services;
(B) Production of simple items;
(C) Rote entry or routine integration of
Government-furnished information; or
(D) Simple operations with Government-furnished
property.
(4) Technology incentive range. (i)
The contracting officer may assign values within the technology
incentive range when contract performance includes the introduction
of new, significant technological innovation. Use the technology
incentive range only for the most innovative contract efforts. Innovation
may be in the form of -
(A) Development or application of new technology
that fundamentally changes the characteristics of an existing product
or system and that results in increased technical performance, improved
reliability, or reduced costs; or
(B) New products or systems that contain
significant technological advances over the products or systems
they are replacing.
(ii) When selecting a value within the
technology incentive range, the contracting officer should consider
the relative value of the proposed innovation to the acquisition
as a whole. When the innovation represents a minor benefit, the contracting
officer should consider using values less than the norm. For innovative
efforts that will have a major positive impact on the product or
program, the contracting officer may use values above the norm.
(e) Evaluation criteria for management/cost
control. (1) The contracting officer should evaluate -
(i) The contractor's management and internal
control systems using contracting office data, information and reviews made
by field contract administration offices or other DoD field offices;
(ii) The management involvement expected
on the prospective contract action;
(iii) The degree of cost mix as an indication
of the types of resources applied and value added by the contractor;
(iv) The contractor's support of Federal
socioeconomic programs;
(v) The expected reliability of the contractor's
cost estimates (including the contractor's cost estimating system);
(vi) The adequacy of the contractor's management
approach to controlling cost and schedule; and
(vii) Any other factors that affect the
contractor's ability to meet the cost targets (e.g., foreign currency
exchange rates and inflation rates).
(2) Above normal conditions. (i)
The contracting officer may assign a higher than normal value when
there is a high degree of management effort. Indicators of this
are -
(A) The contractor's value added is both
considerable and reasonably difficult;
(B) The effort involves a high degree of
integration or coordination;
(C) The contractor has a good record of
past performance;
(D) The contractor has a substantial record
of active participation in Federal socioeconomic programs;
(E) The contractor provides fully documented
and reliable cost estimates;
(F) The contractor makes appropriate make-or-buy
decisions; or
(G) The contractor has a proven record
of cost tracking and control.
(ii) The contracting officer may justify
a maximum value when the effort -
(A) Requires large scale integration of
the most complex nature;
(B) Involves major international activities
with significant management coordination (e.g., offsets with foreign
vendors); or
(C) Has critically important milestones.
(iii) If the contractor demonstrates efficient
management and cost control through the submittal of a timely, qualifying proposal
(as defined in217.7401) in furtherance of definitization of an undefinitized
contract action, and the proposal demonstrates effective cost control
from the time of award to the present, the contracting officer may
add 1 percentage point to the value determined for management/cost
control up to the maximum of 7 percent.
(3) Below normal conditions. (i)
The contracting officer may assign a lower than normal value when
the management effort is minimal. Indicators of this are -
(A) The program is mature and many end
item deliveries have been made;
(B) The contractor adds minimal value to
an item;
(C) The efforts are routine and require
minimal supervision;
(D) The contractor provides poor quality,
untimely proposals;
(E) The contractor fails to provide an
adequate analysis of subcontractor costs;
(F) The contractor does not cooperate in
the evaluation and negotiation of the proposal;
(G) The contractor's cost estimating system
is marginal;
(H) The contractor has made minimal effort
to initiate cost reduction programs;
(I) The contractor's cost proposal is inadequate;
(J) The contractor has a record of cost
overruns or another indication of unreliable cost estimates and
lack of cost control; or
(K) The contractor has a poor record of
past performance.
(ii) The following may justify a value
significantly below normal -
(A) Reviews performed by the field contract
administration offices disclose unsatisfactory management and internal control
systems (e.g., quality assurance, property control, safety, security);
or
(B) The effort requires an unusually low
degree of management involvement.","[""(a) Description. This profit\nfactor addresses the contractor's degree of risk in fulfilling the\ncontract requirements.

215.404-71-3,Contract type risk and working capital adjustment.,"(a) Description. The contract type risk factor focuses on the degree of cost risk accepted by the contractor under varying contract types. The working capital adjustment is an adjustment added to the profit objective for contract type risk. It only applies to fixed-price contracts that provide for progress payments. Though it uses a formula approach, it is not intended to be an exact calculation of the cost of working capital. Its purpose is to give general recognition to the contractor's cost of working capital under varying contract circumstances, financing policies, and the economic environment.
(b) Determination. The following extract from the DD 1547 is annotated to explain the process.
(1) Select a value from the list of contract types in paragraph (c) of this section using the evaluation criteria in paragraph (d) of this section. See paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(2)(i) Insert the amount of costs incurred as of the date the contractor submits a qualifying proposal, such as under an undefinitized contract action, (excluding facilities capital cost of money) into the Block 24a column titled Base.
(ii) Insert the amount of Government estimated cost to complete (excluding facilities capital cost of money) into the Block 24b column titled Base.
(3) Multiply (1) by (2)(i) and (2)(ii), respectively for Blocks 24a and 24b. Add Blocks 24a and 24b and insert the totals in Block 24c.
(4) Only complete this block when the prospective contract is a fixed-price contract containing provisions for progress payments.
(5) Insert the amount computed per paragraph (e) of this subsection.
(6) Insert the appropriate figure from paragraph (f) of this subsection.
(7) Use the interest rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury (see https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/fsservices/gov/pmt/promptPayment/rates.htm ). Do not use any other interest rate.
(8) Multiply (5) by (6) by (7). This is the working capital adjustment. It shall not exceed 4 percent of the contract costs in Block 20.
(c) Values: Normal and designated ranges.
(1) “No financing” means either that the contract does not provide progress payments or performance-based payments, or that the contract provides them only on a limited basis, such as financing of first articles. Do not compute a working capital adjustment.
(2) When the contract contains provisions for progress payments, compute a working capital adjustment (Block 25).
(3) For the purposes of assigning profit values, treat a fixed-price contract with redetermination provisions as if it were a fixed-price incentive contract with below normal conditions.
(4) Cost-plus contracts shall not receive the working capital adjustment.
(5) These types of contracts are considered cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts for the purposes of assigning profit values. They shall not receive the working capital adjustment in Block 25. However, they may receive higher than normal values within the designated range to the extent that portions of cost are fixed.
(6) When the contract contains provisions for performance-based payments, do not compute a working capital adjustment.
(d) Evaluation criteria - (1) General. The contracting officer should consider elements that affect contract type risk such as -
(i) Length of contract;
(ii) Adequacy of cost data for projections;
(iii) Economic environment;
(iv) Nature and extent of subcontracted activity;
(v) Protection provided to the contractor under contract provisions (e.g., economic price adjustment clauses);
(vi) The ceilings and share lines contained in incentive provisions;
(vii) Risks associated with contracts for foreign military sales (FMS) that are not funded by U.S. appropriations; and
(viii) When the contract contains provisions for performance-based payments -
(A) The frequency of payments;
(B) The total amount of payments compared to the maximum allowable amount specified at FAR 32.1004(b)(2); and
(C) The risk of the payment schedule to the contractor.
(2) Mandatory. (i) The contracting officer shall assess the extent to which costs have been incurred prior to definitization of the contract action (also see 217.7404-6 (a) and 243.204-70 -6). When costs have been incurred prior to definitization, generally regard the contract type risk to be in the low end of the designated range. If a substantial portion of the costs have been incurred prior to definitization, the contracting officer may assign a value as low as zero percent, regardless of contract type. However, if a contractor submits a qualifying proposal to definitize an undefinitized contract action and the contracting officer for such action definitizes the contract after the end of the 180-day period beginning on the date on which the contractor submitted the qualifying proposal (as defined in 217.7401 ), the profit allowed on the contract shall accurately reflect the cost risk of the contractor as such risk existed on the date the contractor submitted the qualifying proposal.
(ii) Contracting officers shall document in the price negotiation memorandum the reason for assigning a specific contract type risk value, to include the extent to which any reduced cost risk during the undefinitized period of performance was considered, in determining the negotiation objective.
(3) Above normal conditions. The contracting officer may assign a higher than normal value when there is substantial contract type risk. Indicators of this are -
(i) Efforts where there is minimal cost history;
(ii) Long-term contracts without provisions protecting the contractor, particularly when there is considerable economic uncertainty;
(iii) Incentive provisions (e.g., cost and performance incentives) that place a high degree of risk on the contractor;
(iv) FMS sales (other than those under DoD cooperative logistics support arrangements or those made from U.S. Government inventories or stocks) where the contractor can demonstrate that there are substantial risks above those normally present in DoD contracts for similar items; or
(v) An aggressive performance-based payment schedule that increases risk.
(4) Below normal conditions. The contracting officer may assign a lower than normal value when the contract type risk is low. Indicators of this are -
(i) Very mature product line with extensive cost history;
(ii) Relative short-term contracts;
(iii) Contractual provisions that substantially reduce the contractor's risk;
(iv) Incentive provisions that place a low degree of risk on the contractor;
(v) Performance-based payments totaling the maximum allowable amount(s) specified at FAR 32.1004(b)(2); or
(vi) A performance-based payment schedule that is routine with minimal risk.
(e) Costs financed. (1) Costs financed equal total costs multiplied by the portion (percent) of costs financed by the contractor.
(2) Total costs equal Block 20 (i.e., all allowable costs excluding facilities capital cost of money), reduced as appropriate when -
(i) The contractor has little cash investment (e.g., subcontractor progress payments liquidated late in period of performance);
(ii) Some costs are covered by special financing provisions, such as advance payments; or
(iii) The contract is multiyear and there are special funding arrangements.
(3) The portion that the contractor finances is generally the portion not covered by progress payments, i.e., 100 percent minus the customary progress payment rate (see FAR 32.501). For example, if a contractor receives progress payments at 80 percent, the portion that the contractor finances is 20 percent. On contracts that provide progress payments to small businesses, use the customary progress payment rate for large businesses.
(f) Contract length factor. (1) This is the period of time that the contractor has a working capital investment in the contract. It -
(i) Is based on the time necessary for the contractor to complete the substantive portion of the work;
(ii) Is not necessarily the period of time between contract award and final delivery (or final payment), as periods of minimal effort should be excluded;
(iii) Should not include periods of performance contained in option provisions; and
(iv) Should not, for multiyear contracts, include periods of performance beyond that required to complete the initial program year's requirements.
(2) The contracting officer -
(i) Should use the following table to select the contract length factor;
(ii) Should develop a weighted average contract length when the contract has multiple deliveries; and
(iii) May use sampling techniques provided they produce a representative result.
(3) Example: A prospective contract has a performance period of 40 months with end items being delivered in the 34th, 36th, 38th, and 40th months of the contract. The average period is 37 months and the contract length factor is 1.15.","[""(a) Description.

215.404-71-4,Facilities capitalemployed.,"(a) Description . This factor
focuses on encouraging and rewarding capital investment in facilities
that benefit DoD. It recognizes both the facilities capital that
the contractor will employ in contract performance and the contractor's
commitment to improving productivity.
(b) Contract facilities capital estimates .
The contracting officer shall estimate the facilities capital cost
of money and capital employed using—
(1) An analysis of the appropriate Forms
CASB-CMF and cost of money factors (48 CFR 9904.414 and FAR 31.205-10); and
(2) DD Form 1861, Contract Facilities Capital
Cost of Money.
(c) Use of DD Form 1861 . See PGI 215.404-71 -4(c)
for obtaining field pricing support for preparing DD Form 1861.
(1) Purpose . The DD Form 1861 provides
a means of linking the Form CASB-CMF and DD Form 1547, Record of Weighted
Guidelines Application. It—
(i) Enables the contracting officer to
differentiate profit objectives for various types of assets (land,
buildings, equipment). The procedure is similar to applying overhead
rates to appropriate overhead allocation bases to determine contract
overhead costs.
(ii) Is designed to record and compute
the contract facilities capital cost of money and capital employed
which is carried forward to DD Form 1547.
(2) Completion instructions . Complete
a DD Form 1861 only after evaluating the contractor's cost proposal,
establishing cost of money factors, and establishing a prenegotiation
objective on cost. Complete the form as follows:
(i) List overhead pools and direct-charging
service centers (if used) in the same structure as they appear on
the contractor's cost proposal and Form CASB-CMF. The structure
and allocation base units-of-measure must be compatible on all three
displays.
(ii) Extract appropriate contract overhead
allocation base data, by year, from the evaluated cost breakdown
or prenegotiation cost objective and list against each overhead
pool and direct-charging service center.
(iii) Multiply each allocation base by
its corresponding cost of money factor to get the facilities capital
cost of money estimated to be incurred each year. The sum of these
products represents the estimated contract facilities capital cost of
money for the year's effort.
(iv) Total contract facilities cost of
money is the sum of the yearly amounts.
(v) Since the facilities capital cost of
money factors reflect the applicable cost of money rate in Column
1 of Form CASB-CMF, divide the contract cost of money by that same
rate to determine the contract facilities capital employed.
(d) Preaward facilities capital applications .
To establish cost and price objectives, apply the facilities capital
cost of money and capital employed as follows:
(1) Cost of Money.
(i) Cost Objective . Use the imputed
facilities capital cost of money, with normal, booked costs, to
establish a cost objective or the target cost when structuring an
incentive type contract. Do not adjust target costs established
at the outset even though actual cost of money rates become available
during the period of contract performance.
(ii) Profit Objective . When measuring
the contractor's effort for the purpose of establishing a prenegotiation
profit objective, restrict the cost base to normal, booked costs.
Do not include cost of money as part of the cost base.
(2) Facilities Capital Employed .
Assess and weight the profit objective for risk associated with
facilities capital employed in accordance with the profit guidelines
at 215.404-71 -4.
(e) Determination . The following
extract from the DD Form 1547 has been annotated to explain the
process.
(1) Select a value from the list in paragraph
(f) of this subsection using the evaluation criteria in paragraph
(g) of this subsection.
(2) Use the allocated facilities capital
attributable to land, buildings, and equipment, as derived in DD
Form 1861, Contract Facilities Capital Cost of Money.
(i) In addition to the net book value of
facilities capital employed, consider facilities capital that is
part of a formal investment plan if the contractor submits reasonable
evidence that—
(A) Achievable benefits to DoD will result
from the investment; and
(B) The benefits of the investment are
included in the forward pricing structure.
(ii) If the value of intracompany transfers
has been included in Block 20 at cost (i.e., excluding general and
administrative (G&A) expenses and profit), add to the contractor's
allocated facilities capital, the allocated facilities capital attributable
to the buildings and equipment of those corporate divisions supplying
the intracompany transfers. Do not make this addition if the value
of intracompany transfers has been included in Block 20 at price
(i.e., including G&A expenses and profit).
(3) Multiply (1) by (2).
(f) Values: Normal and designated ranges .
(g) Evaluation criteria .
(1) In evaluating facilities capital employed,
the contracting officer—
(i) Should relate the usefulness of the
facilities capital to the goods or services being acquired under
the prospective contract;
(ii) Should analyze the productivity improvements
and other anticipated industrial base enhancing benefits resulting from
the facilities capital investment, including—
(A) The economic value of the facilities
capital, such as physical age, undepreciated value, idleness, and
expected contribution to future defense needs; and
(B) The contractor's level of investment
in defense related facilities as compared with the portion of the
contractor's total business that is derived from DoD; and
(iii) Should consider any contractual provisions
that reduce the contractor's risk of investment recovery, such as
termination protection clauses and capital investment indemnification.
(2) Above normal conditions .
(i) The contracting officer may assign
a higher than normal value if the facilities capital investment
has direct, identifiable, and exceptional benefits. Indicators are—
(A) New investments in state-of-the-art
technology that reduce acquisition cost or yield other tangible
benefits such as improved product quality or accelerated deliveries;
or
(B) Investments in new equipment for research
and development applications.
(ii) The contracting officer may assign
a value significantly above normal when there are direct and measurable
benefits in efficiency and significantly reduced acquisition costs
on the effort being priced. Maximum values apply only to those cases
where the benefits of the facilities capital investment are substantially
above normal.
(3) Below normal conditions .
(i) The contracting officer may assign
a lower than normal value if the facilities capital investment has
little benefit to DoD. Indicators are—
(A) Allocations of capital apply predominantly
to commercial item lines;
(B) Investments are for such things as
furniture and fixtures, home or group level administrative offices,
corporate aircraft and hangars, gymnasiums; or
(C) Facilities are old or extensively idle.
(ii) The contracting officer may assign
a value significantly below normal when a significant portion of
defense manufacturing is done in an environment characterized by
outdated, inefficient, and labor-intensive capital equipment.","[""(a) Description . This factor\nfocuses on encouraging and rewarding capital investment in facilities\nthat benefit DoD.

215.404-71-5,Cost efficiency factor.,"(a)  This special factor provides an incentive for contractors to reduce costs.  To the extent that the contractor can demonstrate cost reduction efforts that benefit the pending contract, the contracting officer may increase the prenegotiation profit objective by an amount not to exceed 4 percent of total objective cost (Block 20 of the DD Form 1547) to recognize these efforts (Block 29).
(b)  To determine if using this factor is appropriate, the contracting officer shall consider criteria, such as the following, to evaluate the benefit the contractor’s cost reduction efforts will have on the pending contract:
(1)  The contractor’s participation in Single Process Initiative improvements;
(2)  Actual cost reductions achieved on prior contracts;
(3)  Reduction or elimination of excess or idle facilities;
(4)  The contractor’s cost reduction initiatives (e.g., competition advocacy programs, technical insertion programs, obsolete parts control programs, spare parts pricing reform, value engineering, outsourcing of functions such as information technology).  Metrics developed by the contractor such as fully loaded labor hours (i.e., cost per labor hour, including all direct and indirect costs) or other productivity measures may provide the basis for assessing the effectiveness of the contractor’s cost reduction initiatives over time;
(5)  The contractor’s adoption of process improvements to reduce costs;
(6)  Subcontractor cost reduction efforts;
(7)  The contractor’s effective incorporation of commercial items and processes; or
(8)  The contractor’s investment in new facilities when such investments contribute to better asset utilization or improved productivity.
(c)  When selecting the percentage to use for this special factor, the contracting officer has maximum flexibility in determining the best way to evaluate the benefit the contractor’s cost reduction efforts will have on the pending contract.  However, the contracting officer shall consider the impact that quantity differences, learning, changes in scope, and economic factors such as inflation and deflation will have on cost reduction.","['(a)  This special factor provides an incentive for contractors to reduce costs.

(i) Exception for prices set by law or regulation - Identification of the law or regulation establishing the prices offered. If the prices are controlled under law by periodic rulings, reviews, or similar actions of a governmental body, attach a copy of the controlling document, unless it was previously submitted to the contracting office.
(ii) Commercial item exception . For a commercial item exception, the Offeror shall submit, at a minimum, information that is adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the price for this acquisition, including prices at which the same item or similar items have been sold in the commercial market.

(a) Definitions. As
used in this clause—
“Commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) item”—
(1) Means any item of supply (including construction material) that is—
(i) A commercial item (as defined in paragraph (1) of the definition of
            “commercial item” in section 2.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation);
(ii) Sold in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace; and
(iii) Offered to the Government, under a contract or subcontract at any tier,
            without modification, in the same form in which it is sold in the commercial
            marketplace; and
(2) Does not include bulk cargo, as defined in 46 U.S.C. 40102(4), such as
            agricultural products and petroleum products.
“Component” means an article, material, or supply
incorporated directly into an end product.
“Domestic end product” means—
(1) For an end product that does not
            consist wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a combination of both—
(i) An unmanufactured end product mined or produced in the United States;
            or
(ii) An end product manufactured
in the United States if—
(A) The cost of its qualifying
            country components and its components that are mined, produced, or manufactured in the
            United States exceeds 55 percent of the cost of all
            its components. The cost of components includes transportation costs to the place of
            incorporation into the end product and U.S. duty (whether or not a duty-free entry
            certificate is issued). Components of unknown origin are
               treated as foreign. Scrap generated, collected, and prepared for processing in
            the United States is considered domestic. A component is considered to have been mined,
            produced, or manufactured in the United States (regardless of its source in fact) if the
            end product in which it is incorporated is manufactured in the United States and the
            component is of a class or kind for which the Government has determined that—
(1) Sufficient and
reasonably available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality
are not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States; or
(2) It is inconsistent
with the public interest to apply the restrictions of the Buy American
statute; or
(B) The end product is a
COTS item.
(2) For an end product that consists
            wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a combination of both, an end product
            manufactured in the United States, if the cost of iron and steel not produced in the
            United States or a qualifying country constitutes less than 5 percent of the cost of all
            the components used in the end product (produced in the United States or a qualifying
            country means that all manufacturing processes of the iron or steel must take place in
            the United States or a qualifying country, except metallurgical processes involving
            refinement of steel additives). The cost of iron and steel not produced in the United
            States or a qualifying country includes but is not limited to the cost of iron or steel
            mill products (such as bar, billet, slab, wire, plate, or sheet), castings, or forgings,
            not produced in the United States or a qualifying country, utilized in the manufacture
            of the end product and a good faith estimate of the cost of all iron or steel components
            not produced in the United States or a qualifying country, excluding COTS fasteners.
            Iron or steel components of unknown origin are treated as foreign. If the end product
            contains multiple components, the cost of all the materials used in such end product is
            calculated in accordance with the explanation of cost of components in paragraph
            (1)(ii)(A) of this definition.
“End product” means those articles, materials,
and supplies to be acquired under this contract for public use.
“Foreign end product” means an end product other
than a domestic end product.
“Predominantly of iron or steel or a combination of both”
            means that the cost of the iron and steel content exceeds 50 percent of the total cost
            of all its components. The cost of iron and steel is the cost of the iron or steel mill
            products (such as bar, billet, slab, wire, plate, or sheet), castings, or forgings
            utilized in the manufacture of the product and a good faith estimate of the cost of iron
            or steel components excluding COTS fasteners.
“Qualifying country” means a country with a reciprocal
defense procurement memorandum of understanding or international agreement
with the United States in which both countries agree to remove barriers
to purchases of supplies produced in the other country or services
performed by sources of the other country, and the memorandum or
agreement complies, where applicable, with the requirements of section
36 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2776) and with 10 U.S.C.
2457. Accordingly, the following are qualifying countries:
Australia
Austria

United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
“Qualifying country component” means a component
mined, produced, or manufactured in a qualifying country.
“Qualifying country end product” means—
(1) An unmanufactured end product
            mined or produced in a qualifying country; or
(2) An end product manufactured in a
            qualifying country if —
(i) The cost of the following types
            of components exceeds 50 percent of the cost of all its components:
(A) Components mined, produced, or
            manufactured in a qualifying country.
(B) Components mined, produced, or
            manufactured in the United States.
(C) Components of foreign origin of a
            class or kind for which the Government has determined that sufficient and reasonably
            available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality are not mined, produced, or
            manufactured in the United States. Components of unknown
               origin are treated as foreign; or
(ii) The end product is a COTS
            item.
“United States” means the 50 States, the District
of Columbia, and outlying areas.
“Steel” means an alloy that includes at least 50 percent
            iron, between 0.02 and 2 percent carbon, and may include other elements.
(b) This clause implements
41 U.S.C chapter 83, Buy American. In accordance with 41 U.S.C.
1907, the component test of the Buy American statute is waived for
an end product that is a COTS item (see section 12.505(a)(1) of
the Federal Acquisition Regulation). Unless otherwise specified,
this clause applies to all line items in the contract.
(c) The Contractor shall
deliver only domestic end products unless, in its offer, it specified
delivery of other end products in the Buy American—Balance of Payments
Program Certificate provision of the solicitation. If the Contractor
certified in its offer that it will deliver a qualifying country
end product, the Contractor shall deliver a qualifying country end
product or, at the Contractor’s option, a domestic end product.
(d) The contract price does
not include duty for end products or components for which the Contractor

(a) Definitions. As
used in this clause—
“Bahrainian end product” means an article that—
(1) Is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of Bahrain; or
(2) In the case of an article that consists in whole or in part of materials
            from another country, has been substantially transformed in Bahrain into a new and
            different article of commerce with a name, character, or use distinct from that of the
            article or articles from which it was transformed. The term refers to a product offered
            for purchase under a supply contract, but for purposes of calculating the value of the
            end product includes services (except transportation services) incidental to its supply,
            provided that the value of those incidental services does not exceed the value of the
            product itself.
“Commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) item”—
(1) Means any item of supply (including construction material) that is—
(i) A commercial item (as defined in paragraph (1) of the definition of
            “commercial item” in section 2.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation);
(ii) Sold in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace; and
(iii) Offered to the Government, under a contract or subcontract at any tier,
            without modification, in the same form in which it is sold in the commercial
            marketplace; and
(2) Does not include bulk cargo, as defined in 46 U.S.C. 40102(4), such as
            agricultural products and petroleum products.
“Component” means an article, material, or supply
incorporated directly into an end product.
“Domestic end product” means—
(1) For an end product that does not consist wholly or predominantly
            of iron or steel or a combination of both—
(i) An unmanufactured end
product that has been mined or produced in the United States; or
(ii) An end product manufactured
in the United States if—
(A) The cost of its qualifying
            country components and its components that are mined, produced, or manufactured in the
            United States exceeds 50 percent of the cost of all its components. The cost of
            components includes transportation costs to the place of incorporation into the end
            product and U.S. duty (whether or not a duty-free entry certificate is issued). Components of unknown origin are treated as foreign.
            Scrap generated, collected, and prepared for processing in the United States is
            considered domestic. A component is considered to have been mined, produced, or
            manufactured in the United States (regardless of its source in fact) if the end product
            in which it is incorporated is manufactured in the United States and the component is of
            a class or kind for which the Government has determined that—
(1) Sufficient and reasonably available commercial
            quantities of a satisfactory quality are not mined, produced, or manufactured in the
            United States; or
(2) It is inconsistent with the public interest to
            apply the restrictions of the Buy American statute; or
(B) The end product is a COTS item;
               or
(2) For an end product that consists
            wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a combination of both, an end product
            manufactured in the United States, if the cost of iron and steel not produced in the
            United States or a qualifying country constitutes less than 5 percent of the cost of all
            the components used in the end product (produced in the United States or a qualifying
            country means that all manufacturing processes of the iron or steel must take place in
            the United States or a qualifying country, except metallurgical processes involving
            refinement of steel additives). The cost of iron and steel not produced in the United
            States or a qualifying country includes but is not limited to the cost of iron or steel
            mill products (such as bar, billet, slab, wire, plate, or sheet), castings, or forgings,
            not produced in the United States or a qualifying country, utilized in the manufacture
            of the end product and a good faith estimate of the cost of all iron or steel components
            not produced in the United States or a qualifying country, excluding COTS fasteners.
            Iron or steel components of unknown origin are treated as foreign. If the end product
            contains multiple components, the cost of all the materials used in such end product is

BALANCE OF
            PAYMENTS PROGRAM—CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL—BASIC (JUN 2022)
(a) Definitions. As used in this clause—
“Commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) item”—
(1) Means
            any item of supply (including construction material) that is—
(i) A
            commercial item (as defined in paragraph (1) of the definition of “commercial item” in
            section 2.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation);
(ii)
             Sold in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace; and
(iii)
            Offered to the Government, under a contract or subcontract at any tier, without
            modification, in the same form in which it is sold in the commercial marketplace;
            and
(2) Does not
            include bulk cargo, as defined in 46 U.S.C. 40102(4), such as agricultural products and
            petroleum products.
“Component” means any article, material, or supply incorporated directly into construction material.
“Construction material” means an article, material, or supply brought to the construction site by the Contractor or a subcontractor for incorporation into the building or work.  The term also includes an item brought to the site preassembled from articles, materials, or supplies.  However, emergency life safety systems, such as emergency lighting, fire alarm, and audio evacuation systems, that are discrete systems incorporated into a public building or work and that are produced as complete systems, are evaluated as a single and distinct construction material regardless of when or how the individual parts or components of those systems are delivered to the construction site.  Materials purchased directly by the Government are supplies, not construction material.
“Cost of components” means—
(1) For
            components purchased by the Contractor, the acquisition cost, including transportation
            costs to the place of incorporation into the end product (whether or not such costs are
            paid to a domestic firm), and any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free entry
            certificate is issued); or
(2) For
            components manufactured by the Contractor, all costs associated with the manufacture of
            the component, including transportation costs as described in paragraph (1) of this
            definition, plus allocable overhead costs, but excluding profit. Cost of components does
            not include any costs associated with the manufacture of the construction material.
“Domestic construction material” means—
(1) For construction material that does
            not consist wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a combination of both—
(i)  An unmanufactured construction material mined or produced in the United States; or
(ii)  A construction material manufactured in the United States, if—
(A) The cost of its components mined, produced,
            or manufactured in the United States exceeds 55
               percent of the cost of all its components. Components of foreign origin of the
            same class or kind for which nonavailability determinations have been made are treated
            as domestic. Components of unknown origin are treated as
               foreign; or
(B) The construction material is a COTS item; or
(2) For construction material that
            consists wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a combination of both, a
            construction material manufactured in the United States if the cost of iron and steel
            not produced in the United States (excluding fasteners) as estimated in good faith by
            the contractor, constitutes less than 5 percent of the cost of all the components used
            in such construction material (produced in the United States means that all
            manufacturing processes of the iron or steel must take place in the United States,
            except metallurgical processes involving refinement of steel additives). The cost of
            iron and steel not produced in the United States includes but is not limited to the cost
            of iron or steel mill products (such as bar, billet, slab, wire, plate, or sheet),
            castings, or forgings, not produced in the United States, utilized in the manufacture of
            the end product and a good faith estimate of the cost of all iron or steel components
            not produced in the United States, excluding COTS fasteners. Iron or steel components of
            unknown origin are treated as foreign. If the construction material contains multiple
            components, the cost of all the materials used in such construction material is
            calculated in accordance with the definition of “cost of components” in this clause.
“Predominantly of iron or steel or a combination of both”
            means that the cost of the iron and steel content exceeds 50 percent of the total cost
            of all its components. The cost of iron and steel is the cost of the iron or steel mill
            products (such as bar, billet, slab, wire, plate, or sheet), castings, or forgings
            utilized in the manufacture of the product and a good faith estimate of the cost of iron
            or steel components excluding COTS fasteners.
“Steel” means an alloy that includes at least 50 percent
            iron, between 0.02 and 2 percent carbon, and may include other elements.
“United States” means the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and outlying areas.
(b) Domestic preference. This clause implements the Balance of Payments Program by providing a preference for domestic construction material.  The Contractor shall use only domestic construction material in performing this contract, except for—
(1)  Construction material valued at or below the simplified acquisition threshold in part 2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation;
(2)  Information technology that is a commercial item; or
(3)  The construction material or components listed by the Government as follows:

operating instructions, and other similar items, regardless of storage
medium, that explain the capabilities of the computer software or
provide instructions for using the software.
(5)”Covered Government support
contractor” means a contractor (other than a litigation support
contractor covered by 252.204-7014 ) under a
contract, the primary purpose of which is to furnish independent
and impartial advice or technical assistance directly to the Government
in support of the Government’s management and oversight of a program or
effort (rather than to directly furnish an end item or service to
accomplish a program or effort), provided that the contractor—
(i) Is not affiliated with
the prime contractor or a first-tier subcontractor on the program
or effort, or with any direct competitor of such prime contractor
or any such first-tier subcontractor in furnishing end items or
services of the type developed or produced on the program or effort;

the manufacturer to produce an item or component or to perform a
process.
(7) “Developed” means that

item or component must have been constructed or the process practiced.
Workability is generally established when the item, component, or
process has been analyzed or tested sufficiently to demonstrate
to reasonable people skilled in the applicable art that there is
a high probability that it will operate as intended. Whether, how
much, and what type of analysis or testing is required to establish
workability depends on the nature of the item, component, or process,
and the state of the art. To be considered “developed,” the item,
component, or process need not be at the stage where it could be
offered for sale or sold on the commercial market, nor must the
item, component, or process be actually reduced to practice within
the meaning of Title 35 of the United States Code.
(8) “Developed exclusively

price of the contract, the additional development costs necessary
to complete development shall not be considered when determining whether
development was at government, private, or mixed expense.
(9) “Developed exclusively
with government funds” means development was not accomplished exclusively
or partially at private expense.
(10) “Developed with mixed
funding” means development was accomplished partially with costs
charged to indirect cost pools and/or costs not allocated to a government

functional, and performance characteristics (along with the qualification
requirements, if applicable) of an item, component, or process to
the extent necessary to permit identification of physically and
functionally interchangeable items.
(12) “Government purpose”
means any activity in which the United States Government is a party,
including cooperative agreements with international or multi-national
defense organizations, or sales or transfers by the United States
Government to foreign governments or international organizations.
Government purposes include competitive procurement, but do not
include the rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform,
display, or disclose technical data for commercial purposes or authorize
others to do so.
(13) “Government purpose
rights” means the rights to—
(i) Use, modify, reproduce,
release, perform, display, or disclose technical data within the
Government without restriction; and
(ii) Release or disclose
technical data outside the Government and authorize persons to whom
release or disclosure has been made to use, modify, reproduce, release,
perform, display, or disclose that data for United States government purposes.
(14) “Limited rights” means
the rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display,
or disclose technical data, in whole or in part, within the Government.
The Government may not, without the written permission of the party
asserting limited rights, release or disclose the technical data
outside the Government, use the technical data for manufacture, or
authorize the technical data to be used by another party, except
that the Government may reproduce, release, or disclose such data
or authorize the use or reproduction of the data by persons outside
the Government if—
(i) The reproduction, release,
disclosure, or use is—

of technical data other than detailed manufacturing or process data,
when use of such data by the foreign government is in the interest
of the Government and is required for evaluational or informational
purposes;
(ii) The recipient of the
technical data is subject to a prohibition on the further reproduction,
release, disclosure, or use of the technical data; and
(iii) The contractor or subcontractor
asserting the restriction is notified of such reproduction, release,
disclosure, or use.
(15) “Technical data” means
recorded information, regardless of the form or method of the recording,
of a scientific or technical nature (including computer software
documentation). The term does not include computer software or data incidental
to contract administration, such as financial and/or management
information.
(16) “Unlimited rights” means
rights to use, modify, reproduce, perform, display, release, or
disclose technical data in whole or in part, in any manner, and
for any purpose whatsoever, and to have or authorize others to do
so.
(b) Rights in technical
data . The Contractor grants or shall obtain for the Government

its assets to another party;
(viii) Data in which the
Government has obtained unlimited rights under another Government
contract or as a result of negotiations; or

licenses obtained on behalf of the Government and other persons
to the data transmittal document.
(e) Identification and
delivery of data to be furnished with restrictions on use, release,
or disclosure .
(1) This paragraph does not
apply to restrictions based solely on copyright.
(2) Except as provided in
paragraph (e)(3) of this clause, technical data that the Contractor
asserts should be furnished to the Government with restrictions

Identification and Assertion of Restrictions on
the Government's Use, Release, or Disclosure of Technical Data.
The Contractor asserts for itself, or the persons
identified below, that the Government's rights to use, release,
or disclose the following technical data should be restricted—
*If the assertion is applicable to items, components,
or processes developed at private expense, identify both the data
and each such item, component, or process.
**Generally, the development of an item, component,
or process at private expense, either exclusively or partially,
is the only basis for asserting restrictions on the Government's
rights to use, release, or disclose technical data pertaining to
such items, components, or processes. Indicate whether development
was exclusively or partially at private expense. If development
was not at private expense, enter the specific reason for asserting
that the Government's rights should be restricted.
***Enter asserted rights category (e.g., government
purpose license rights from a prior contract, rights in SBIR data
generated under another contract, limited or government purpose
rights under this or a prior contract, or specifically negotiated
licenses).
****Corporation, individual, or other person, as
appropriate.
(End of identification and assertion)
(4) When requested by the
Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall provide sufficient information
to enable the Contracting Officer to evaluate the Contractor's assertions.
The Contracting Officer reserves the right to add the Contractor's assertions
to the Attachment and validate any listed assertion, at a later
date, in accordance with the procedures of the Validation of Restrictive
Markings on Technical Data clause of this contract.
(f) Marking requirements .
The Contractor, and its subcontractors or suppliers, may only assert
restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce,
release, perform, display, or disclose technical data to be delivered
under this contract by marking the deliverable data subject to restriction.
Except as provided in paragraph (f)(5) of this clause, only the following
legends are authorized under this contract: the government purpose
rights legend at paragraph (f)(2) of this clause; the limited rights
legend at paragraph (f)(3) of this clause; or the special license
rights legend at paragraph (f)(4) of this clause; and/or a notice
of copyright as prescribed under 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402.
(1) General marking instructions .
The Contractor, or its subcontractors or suppliers, shall conspicuously
and legibly mark the appropriate legend on all technical data that
qualify for such markings. The authorized legends shall be placed
on the transmittal document or storage container and, for printed
material, each page of the printed material containing technical
data for which restrictions are asserted. When only portions of
a page of printed material are subject to the asserted restrictions,
such portions shall be identified by circling, underscoring, with
a note, or other appropriate identifier. Technical data transmitted
directly from one computer or computer terminal to another shall
contain a notice of asserted restrictions. Reproductions of technical
data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions shall
also reproduce the asserted restrictions.
(2) Government purpose
rights markings . Data delivered or otherwise furnished to the
Government with government purpose rights shall be marked as follows:
GOVERNMENT PURPOSE RIGHTS
The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce,
release, perform, display, or disclose these technical data are
restricted by paragraph (b)(2) of the Rights in Technical Data—Noncommercial
Items clause contained in the above identified contract. No restrictions
apply after the expiration date shown above. Any reproduction of
technical data or portions thereof marked with this legend must
also reproduce the markings.

who has been provided access to such data must promptly notify the
above named Contractor.
(End of legend)
(4) Special license rights
markings .

(End of legend)
(ii) For purposes of this
clause, special licenses do not include government purpose license
rights acquired under a prior contract (see paragraph (b)(5) of
this clause).
(5) Pre-existing data
markings . If the terms of a prior contract or license permitted
the Contractor to restrict the Government's rights to use, modify,
reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data
deliverable under this contract, and those restrictions are still
applicable, the Contractor may mark such data with the appropriate
restrictive legend for which the data qualified under the prior
contract or license. The marking procedures in paragraph (f)(1)
of this clause shall be followed.
(g) Contractor procedures
and records . Throughout performance of this contract, the Contractor
and its subcontractors or suppliers that will deliver technical
data with other than unlimited rights, shall—
(1) Have, maintain, and follow
written procedures sufficient to assure that restrictive markings
are used only when authorized by the terms of this clause; and
(2) Maintain records sufficient
to justify the validity of any restrictive markings on technical
data delivered under this contract.
(h) Removal of unjustified
and nonconforming markings .
(1) Unjustified technical
data markings . The rights and obligations of the parties regarding
the validation of restrictive markings on technical data furnished
or to be furnished under this contract are contained in the Validation
of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data clause of this contract.
Notwithstanding any provision of this contract concerning inspection
and acceptance, the Government may ignore or, at the Contractor's
expense, correct or strike a marking if, in accordance with the
procedures in the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical
Data clause of this contract, a restrictive marking is determined
to be unjustified.
(2) Nonconforming technical
data markings . A nonconforming marking is a marking placed on
technical data delivered or otherwise furnished to the Government
under this contract that is not in the format authorized by this
contract. Correction of nonconforming markings is not subject to
the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data clause of
this contract. If the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor
of a nonconforming marking and the Contractor fails to remove or
correct such marking within sixty (60) days, the Government may
ignore or, at the Contractor's expense, remove or correct any nonconforming
marking.
(i) Relation to patents. Nothing
contained in this clause shall imply a license to the Government
under any patent or be construed as affecting the scope of any license
or other right otherwise granted to the Government under any patent.
(j) Limitation on charges
for rights in technical data .
(1) The Contractor shall
not charge to this contract any cost, including, but not limited
to, license fees, royalties, or similar charges, for rights in technical
data to be delivered under this contract when—
(i) The Government has acquired,
by any means, the same or greater rights in the data; or
(ii) The data are available
to the public without restrictions.
(2) The limitation in paragraph
(j)(1) of this clause—
(i) Includes costs charged
by a subcontractor or supplier, at any tier, or costs incurred by
the Contractor to acquire rights in subcontractor or supplier technical
data, if the subcontractor or supplier has been paid for such rights
under any other Government contract or under a license conveying
the rights to the Government; and
(ii) Does not include the
reasonable costs of reproducing, handling, or mailing the documents
or other media in which the technical data will be delivered.
(k) Applicability to subcontractors
or suppliers .
(1) The Contractor shall ensure that the rights afforded its subcontractors and suppliers under 10 U.S.C. 3771-3775 , 10 U.S.C. 3781-3786 , and the identification, assertion, and delivery processes of paragraph (e) of this clause are recognized and protected.
(2) Whenever any technical
data for noncommercial items, or for commercial items developed
in any part at Government expense, is to be obtained from a subcontractor
or supplier for delivery to the Government under this contract,
the Contractor shall use this same clause in the subcontract or
other contractual instrument, including subcontracts or other contractual
instruments for commercial items, and require its subcontractors
or suppliers to do so, without alteration, except to identify the
parties. This clause will govern the technical data pertaining to
noncommercial items or to any portion of a commercial item that
was developed in any part at Government expense, and the clause
at 252.227-7015 will govern the
technical data pertaining to any portion of a commercial item that
was developed exclusively at private expense. No other clause shall
be used to enlarge or diminish the Government's, the Contractor's,
or a higher-tier subcontractor's or supplier's rights in a subcontractor's
or supplier's technical data.
(3) Technical data required
to be delivered by a subcontractor or supplier shall normally be
delivered to the next higher-tier contractor, subcontractor, or
supplier. However, when there is a requirement in the prime contract
for data which may be submitted with other than unlimited rights
by a subcontractor or supplier, then said subcontractor or supplier may
fulfill its requirement by submitting such data directly to the
Government, rather than through a higher-tier contractor, subcontractor,
or supplier.
(4) The Contractor and higher-tier
subcontractors or suppliers shall not use their power to award contracts
as economic leverage to obtain rights in technical data from their
subcontractors or suppliers.
(5) In no event shall the
Contractor use its obligation to recognize and protect subcontractor
or supplier rights in technical data as an excuse for failing to
satisfy its contractual obligation to the Government.

Contractor (or party asserting restrictions) may waive in writing
the requirement for an non-disclosure agreement; and
(iv) Any such non-disclosure
agreement shall address the restrictions on the covered Government
support contractor's use of the data as set forth in the clause
at 252.227-7025 , Limitations

to use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display,
or disclosure restrictions.

items, and require its subcontractors or suppliers to do so, without
alteration, except to identify the parties. This clause will govern
the technical data pertaining to any portion of a commercial item

at 252.227-7013 will govern
the technical data pertaining to any portion of a commercial item

VALIDATION OF RESTRICTIVE MARKINGS ON TECHNICAL DATA (DEC 2022)
(a) Definitions. The terms used in this clause are defined in the Rights in Technical Data—Noncommercial Items clause of this contract.
(b) Commercial items–p resumption regarding development exclusively at private expense . The Contracting Officer will presume that the Contractor’s or a subcontractor’s asserted use or release restrictions with respect to a commercial item are justified on the basis that the item was developed exclusively at private expense. The Contracting Officer will not issue a challenge unless there are reasonable grounds to question the validity of the assertion developed exclusively at private expense.
(c) Justification. The Contractor or subcontractor at any tier is responsible for maintaining records sufficient to justify the validity of its markings that impose restrictions on the Government and others to use, duplicate, or disclose technical data delivered or required to be delivered under the contract or subcontract. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause, the Contractor or subcontractor shall be prepared to furnish to the Contracting Officer a written justification for such restrictive markings in response to a challenge under paragraph (e) of this clause.
(d) Prechallenge request for information.
(1) The Contracting Officer may request the Contractor or subcontractor to furnish a written explanation for any restriction asserted by the Contractor or subcontractor on the right of the United States or others to use technical data. If, upon review of the explanation submitted, the Contracting Officer remains unable to ascertain the basis of the restrictive marking, the Contracting Officer may further request the Contractor or subcontractor to furnish additional information in the records of, or otherwise in the possession of or reasonably available to, the Contractor or subcontractor to justify the validity of any restrictive marking on technical data delivered or to be delivered under the contract or subcontract (e.g., a statement of facts accompanied with supporting documentation). The Contractor or subcontractor shall submit such written data as requested by the Contracting Officer within the time required or such longer period as may be mutually agreed.
(2) If the Contracting Officer, after reviewing the written data furnished pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this clause, or any other available information pertaining to the validity of a restrictive marking, determines that reasonable grounds exist to question the current validity of the marking and that continued adherence to the marking would make impracticable the subsequent competitive acquisition of the item, component, or process to which the technical data relates, the Contracting Officer will follow the procedures in paragraph (e) of this clause.
(3) If the Contractor or subcontractor fails to respond to the Contracting Officer's request for information under paragraph (d)(1) of this clause, and the Contracting Officer determines that continued adherence to the marking would make impracticable the subsequent competitive acquisition of the item, component, or process to which the technical data relates, the Contracting Officer may challenge the validity of the marking as described in paragraph (e) of this clause.
(e) Challenge.
(1) Notwithstanding any provision of this contract concerning inspection and acceptance, if the Contracting Officer determines that a challenge to the restrictive marking is warranted, the Contracting Officer will send a written challenge notice to the Contractor or subcontractor asserting the restrictive markings. The challenge notice and all related correspondence shall be subject to handling procedures for classified information and controlled unclassified information. Such challenge will —
(i) State the specific grounds for challenging the asserted restriction including, for commercial items, sufficient information to reasonably demonstrate that the commercial item was not developed exclusively at private expense
            ;
(ii) Require a response within 60 days justifying and providing sufficient evidence as to the current validity of the asserted restriction;
(iii) State that a DoD Contracting Officer's final decision, issued pursuant to paragraph (g) of this clause, sustaining the validity of a restrictive marking identical to the asserted restriction, within the three-year period preceding the challenge, shall serve as justification for the asserted restriction if the validated restriction was asserted by the same Contractor or subcontractor (or any licensee of such Contractor or subcontractor) to which such notice is being provided; and
(iv) State that failure to respond to the challenge notice may result in issuance of a final decision pursuant to paragraph (f) of this clause.
(2) The Contracting Officer will extend the time for response as appropriate if the Contractor or subcontractor submits a written request showing the need for additional time to prepare a response.
(3) The Contractor's or subcontractor's written response shall be considered a claim within the meaning of 41 U.S.C. 7101, Contract Disputes, and shall be certified in the form prescribed at 33.207 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, regardless of dollar amount.
(4) A Contractor or subcontractor receiving challenges to the same restrictive markings from more than one Contracting Officer shall notify each Contracting Officer of the existence of more than one challenge. The notice shall also state which Contracting Officer initiated the first in time unanswered challenge. The Contracting Officer initiating the first in time unanswered challenge after consultation with the Contractor or subcontractor and the other Contracting Officers, will formulate and distribute a schedule for responding to each of the challenge notices to all interested parties. The schedule will afford the Contractor or subcontractor an opportunity to respond to each challenge notice. All parties will be bound by this schedule.
(f) Final decision when Contractor or subcontractor fails to respond. Upon a failure of a Contractor or subcontractor to submit any response to the challenge notice the Contracting Officer will issue a final decision to the Contractor or subcontractor in accordance with the Disputes clause of this contract. In order to sustain the challenge for commercial items, the Contracting Officer will provide information demonstrating that the commercial item was not developed exclusively at private expense
            . This final decision will be issued as soon as possible after the expiration of the time period of paragraph (e)(1)(ii) or (e)(2) of this clause. Following issuance of the final decision, the Contracting Officer will comply with the procedures in paragraphs (g)(2)(ii) through (iv) of this clause.
(g) Final decision when Contractor or subcontractor responds.
(1) If the Contracting Officer determines that the Contractor or subcontractor has justified the validity of the restrictive marking, the Contracting Officer will issue a final decision to the Contractor or subcontractor sustaining the validity of the restrictive marking, and stating that the Government will continue to be bound by the restrictive marking. This final decision will be issued within 60 days after receipt of the Contractor's or subcontractor's response to the challenge notice, or within such longer period that the Contracting Officer has notified the Contractor or subcontractor that the Government will require. The notification of a longer period for issuance of a final decision will be made within 60 days after receipt of the response to the challenge notice.
(2)(i) If the Contracting Officer determines that the validity of the restrictive marking is not justified, the Contracting Officer will issue a final decision to the Contractor or subcontractor in accordance with the Disputes clause of this contract. In order to sustain the challenge for commercial items, the Contracting Officer will provide information demonstrating that the commercial item was not developed exclusively at private expense. Notwithstanding paragraph (e) of the Disputes clause, the final decision will be issued within 60 days after receipt of the Contractor's or subcontractor's response to the challenge notice, or within such longer period that the Contracting Officer has notified the Contractor or subcontractor that the Government will require. The notification of a longer period for issuance of a final decision will be made within 60 days after receipt of the response to the challenge notice.
(ii) The Government agrees that it will continue to be bound by the restrictive marking for a period of 90 days from the issuance of the Contracting Officer's final decision under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this clause. The Contractor or subcontractor agrees that, if it intends to file suit in the United States Claims Court it will provide a notice of intent to file suit to the Contracting Officer within 90 days from the issuance of the Contracting Officer's final decision under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this clause. If the Contractor or subcontractor fails to appeal, file suit, or provide a notice of intent to file suit to the Contracting Officer within the 90-day period, the Government may cancel or ignore the restrictive markings, and the failure of the Contractor or subcontractor to take the required action constitutes agreement with such Government action.
(iii) The Government agrees that it will continue to be bound by the restrictive marking where a notice of intent to file suit in the United States Claims Court is provided to the Contracting Officer within 90 days from the issuance of the final decision under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this clause. The Government will no longer be bound, and the Contractor or subcontractor agrees that the Government may strike or ignore the restrictive markings, if the Contractor or subcontractor fails to file its suit within 1 year after issuance of the final decision. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the head of an agency determines, on a nondelegable basis, that urgent or compelling circumstances will not permit waiting for the filing of a suit in the United States Claims Court, the Contractor or subcontractor agrees that the agency may, following notice to the Contractor or subcontractor, authorize release or disclosure of the technical data. Such agency determination may be made at any time after issuance of the final decision and will not affect the Contractor's or subcontractor's right to damages against the United States where its restrictive markings are ultimately upheld or to pursue other relief, if any, as may be provided by law.
(iv) The Government agrees that it will be bound by the restrictive marking where an appeal or suit is filed pursuant to the Contract Disputes statute until final disposition by an agency Board of Contract Appeals or the United States Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the head of an agency determines, on a nondelegable basis, following notice to the Contractor that urgent or compelling circumstances will not permit awaiting the decision by such Board of Contract Appeals or the United States Claims Court, the Contractor or subcontractor agrees that the agency may authorize release or disclosure of the technical data. Such agency determination may be made at any time after issuance of the final decision and will not affect the Contractor's or subcontractor's right to damages against the United States where its restrictive markings are ultimately upheld or to pursue other relief, if any, as may be provided by law.
(h) Final disposition of appeal or suit.
(1) If the Contractor or subcontractor appeals or files suit and if, upon final disposition of the appeal or suit, the Contracting Officer's decision is sustained—
(i) The restrictive marking on the technical data shall be cancelled, corrected or ignored; and
(ii) If the restrictive marking is found not to be substantially justified, the Contractor or subcontractor, as appropriate, shall be liable to the Government for payment of the cost to the Government of reviewing the restrictive marking and the fees and other expenses (as defined in 28 U.S.C. 2412(d)(2)(A)) incurred by the Government in challenging the marking, unless special circumstances would make such payment unjust.
(2) If the Contractor or subcontractor appeals or files suit and if, upon final disposition of the appeal or suit, the Contracting Officer's decision is not sustained—
(i) The Government will continue to be bound by the restrictive marking; and
(ii) The Government will be liable to the Contractor or subcontractor for payment of fees and other expenses (as defined in 28 U.S.C. 2412(d)(2)(A)) incurred by the Contractor or subcontractor in defending the marking, if the challenge by the Government is found not to have been made in good faith.
(i) Duration of right to challenge. The Government may review the validity of any restriction on technical data, delivered or to be delivered under a contract, asserted by the Contractor or subcontractor. During the period within three 3 years of final payment on a contract or within three 3 years of delivery of the technical data to the Government, whichever is later, the Contracting Officer may review and make a written determination to challenge the restriction. The Government may, however, challenge a restriction on the release, disclosure , or use of technical data at any time if such technical data—
(1) Is publicly available;
(2) Has been furnished to the United States without restriction; or
(3) Has been otherwise made available without restriction. Only the Contracting Officer's final decision resolving a formal challenge by sustaining the validity of a restrictive marking constitutes “validation” as addressed in 10 U.S.C. 3785(c) .
(j) Decision not to challenge . A decision by the Government, or a determination by the Contracting Officer, to not challenge the restrictive marking or asserted restriction shall not constitute “validation.”
(k) Privity of contract. The Contractor or subcontractor agrees that the Contracting Officer may transact matters under this clause directly with subcontractors at any tier that assert restrictive markings. However, this clause neither creates nor implies privity of contract between the Government and subcontractors.
(l) Flowdown. The Contractor or subcontractor agrees to insert this clause in contractual instruments, including subcontracts and other contractual instruments for commercial items, with its subcontractors or suppliers at any tier requiring the delivery of technical data.

(i) Consider only offers of U.S.-made, qualifying country, or designated country end products, except as permitted by 225.403 or 225.7703-1 .
(ii) If price is the determining factor, award on the low offer.
(c) Use the following procedures instead of those in FAR 25.502(c) for acquisitions subject to the Buy American statute or the Balance of Payments Program:
(i)(A) If the acquisition is subject only to the Buy American or Balance of Payments Program, then only qualifying country end products are exempt from application of the Buy American or Balance of Payments Program evaluation factor.
(B) If the acquisition is also subject to a Free Trade Agreement, then eligible products of the applicable Free Trade Agreement country are also exempt from application of the Buy American or Balance of Payments Program evaluation factor.
(ii) If price is the determining factor, use the following procedures:
(A) If the low offer is a domestic offer, award on that offer.
(B) If there are no domestic offers, award on the
            low offer (see example in PGI 225.504 (1)).
(C) If the low offer is a foreign offer that is exempt from application of the Buy American or Balance of Payments Program evaluation factor, award on that offer. (If the low offer is a qualifying country offer from a country listed at 225.872-1 (b), execute a determination in accordance with 225.872-4 .)
(D) If the low offer is a foreign offer that is
            not exempt from application of the Buy American or Balance of Payments Program
            evaluation factor, and there is another foreign offer that is exempt and is lower than
            the lowest domestic offer, award on the low foreign offer (see example in PGI 225.504 (2)).
(E) Otherwise, apply the 50 percent evaluation factor to the low foreign offer.
( 1 ) If the
            price of the low domestic offer is less than the evaluated price of the low foreign
            offer, award on the low domestic offer (see example in PGI 225.504 (3)).
( 2 ) If the
            evaluated price of the low foreign offer remains less than the low domestic offer, award
            on the low foreign offer (see example in PGI 225.504 (4)).
(iii) If price is not the determining factor, use the following procedures:
(A) If there are domestic offers, apply the 50 percent Buy American or Balance of Payments Program evaluation factor to all foreign offers unless an exemption applies.
(B) Evaluate in accordance with the criteria of the solicitation.
(C) If these procedures will not result in award on a domestic offer, reevaluate offers without the 50 percent factor. If this will result in award on an offer to which the Buy American statute or Balance of Payments Program applies, but evaluation in accordance with paragraph (c)(ii) of this section would result in award on a domestic offer, proceed with award only after execution of a determination in accordance with 225.103 (a)(ii)(B), that domestic preference would be inconsistent with the public interest.
(iv) If the solicitation includes the provision at 252.225-7023 , Preference for Products or Services from Afghanistan, use the evaluation procedures at 225.7703-3 .","['(a) Whenever the acquisition is in support of operations in Afghanistan, treat the offers of end products from South Caucasus or Central and South Asian states listed in 225.401-70 the same as qualifying country offers.', '(b) Use the following procedures instead of the procedures in FAR 25.502(b) for acquisitions subject to the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement:', '(i) Consider only offers of U.S.-made, qualifying country, or designated country end products, except as permitted by 225.403 or 225.7703-1 .', '(ii) If price is the determining factor, award on the low offer.', '(c) Use the following procedures instead of those in FAR 25.502(c) for acquisitions subject to the Buy American statute or the Balance of Payments Program:', '(i)(A) If the acquisition is subject only to the Buy American or Balance of Payments Program, then only qualifying country end products are exempt from application of the Buy American or Balance of Payments Program evaluation factor.', '(B) If the acquisition is also subject to a Free Trade Agreement, then eligible products of the applicable Free Trade Agreement country are also exempt from application of the Buy American or Balance of Payments Program evaluation factor.', '(ii) If price is the determining factor, use the following procedures:', '(A) If the low offer is a domestic offer, award on that offer.', '(B) If there are no domestic offers, award on the\n            low offer (see example in PGI 225.504 (1)).', '(C) If the low offer is a foreign offer that is exempt from application of the Buy American or Balance of Payments Program evaluation factor, award on that offer.

Examples of such costs include, but are not limited to, the following:
(1) Selling expenses (not otherwise limited by FAR Part 31), such as -
(i) Maintaining international sales and service organizations;
(ii) Sales commissions and fees in accordance with FAR Subpart 3.4;
(iii) Sales promotions, demonstrations, and related travel for sales to foreign governments. Section 126.8 of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR 126.8) may require Government approval for these costs to be allowable, in which case the appropriate Government approval shall be obtained; and
(iv) Configuration studies and related technical services undertaken as a direct selling effort to a foreign country.
(2) Product support and post-delivery service expenses, such as -
(i) Operations or maintenance training, training or tactics films, manuals, or other related data; and
(ii) Technical field services provided in a foreign country related to accident investigations, weapon system problems, or operations/tactics enhancement, and related travel to foreign countries.
(3) Offsets. For additional information see 225.7306 .
(i) An offset agreement is the contractual arrangement between the FMS customer and the U.S. defense contractor that identifies the offset obligation imposed by the FMS customer that has been accepted by the U.S. defense contractor as a condition of the FMS customer's purchase. These agreements are distinct and independent of the LOA and the FMS contract. Further information about offsets and LOAs may be found in the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) Security Assistance Management Manual (DSCA 5105.38-M), chapter 6, paragraph 6.3.9. ( http://samm.dsca.mil/chapter/chapter-6 ).
(ii) A U.S. defense contractor may recover all costs incurred for offset agreements with a foreign government or international organization if the LOA is financed wholly with foreign government or international organization customer cash or repayable foreign military finance credits.
(iii) The U.S. Government assumes no obligation to satisfy or administer the offset agreement or to bear any of the associated costs.
(iv) Indirect offset costs are deemed reasonable for purposes of FAR parts 15 and 31 with no further analysis necessary on the part of the contracting officer, provided that the U.S. defense contractor submits to the contracting officer a signed offset agreement or other documentation showing that the FMS customer has made the provision of an indirect offset a condition of the FMS acquisition. FMS customers are placed on notice through the LOA that indirect offset costs are deemed reasonable without any further analysis by the contracting officer.
(4) Costs that are the subject of advance agreement under the appropriate provisions of FAR part 31; or where the advance understanding places a limit on the amounts of cost that will be recognized as allowable in defense contract pricing, and the agreement contemplated that it will apply only to DoD contracts for the U.S. Government's own requirement (as distinguished from contracts for FMS).
(b) Costs not allowable under FAR Part 31 are not allowable in pricing FMS contracts, except as noted in paragraphs (c) and (e) of this subsection.
(c) The limitations for major contractors on independent research and development and bid and proposal (IR&D/B&P) costs for projects that are of potential interest to DoD, in 231.205-18 (c)(iii), do not apply to FMS contracts, except as provided in 225.7303-5 . The allowability of IR&D/B&P costs on contracts for FMS not wholly paid for from funds made available on a nonrepayable basis is limited to the contract's allocable share of the contractor's total IR&D/B&P expenditures. In pricing contracts for such FMS -
(1) Use the best estimate of reasonable costs in forward pricing; and
(2) Use actual expenditures, to the extent that they are reasonable, in determining final cost.
(d) Under paragraph (e)(1)(A) of Section 21 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2761), the United States must charge for administrative services to recover the estimated cost of administration of sales made under the Army Export Control Act.
(e) The limitations in 231.205-1 on allowability of costs associated with leasing Government equipment do not apply to FMS contracts.","['(a) In pricing FMS contracts where non-U.S. Government prices as described in 225.7303-1 do not exist, except as provided in 225.7303-5 , recognize the reasonable and allocable costs of doing business with a foreign government or international organization, even though such costs might not be recognized in the same amounts in pricing other defense contracts.

(A) When considering performance-based
payments, obtain from the offeror/contractor a proposed performance-based
payments schedule that includes all performance-based payments events,
completion criteria and event values along with the projected monthly
expenditure profile in order to negotiate the value of the performance
events such that the performance-based payments are not expected
to result in an unreasonably low or negative level of contractor
investment in the contract.
If performance-based payments are deemed practical,
the Government will evaluate and negotiate the details of the performance-based
payments schedule.

contracts that already use performance-based payments financing,
the basis for negotiation must include performance-based payments.
The PBP analysis tool will be used in the same manner to help determine
the price for the modification;

shall document in the contract file that the performance-based payment
schedule provides a mutually beneficial settlement position that
reflects adequate consideration to the Government for the improved contractor
cash flow.

204.7103-1,Criteria for establishing.,"Contracts shall identify the items or services to be acquired as separate contract line items unless it is not feasible to do so.
(a) Contract line items shall have all four of the following characteristics; however, there are exceptions within the characteristics, which may make establishing a separate contract line item appropriate even though one of the characteristics appears to be missing—
(1) Single unit price . The item shall have a single unit price or a single total price, except—
(i) If the item is not separately priced (NSP) but the price is included in the unit price of another contract line item, enter NSP instead of the unit price;
(ii) When there are associated subline items, established for other than informational reasons, and those subline items are priced in accordance with 204.7104 ;
(iii) When the items or services are being acquired on a cost-reimbursement contract;
(iv) When the contract is for maintenance and repair services (e.g., a labor hour contract) and firm prices have been established for elements of the total price of an item but the actual number and quantity of the elements are not known until performance. The contracting officer may structure these contracts to reflect a firm or estimated total amount for each line item;
(v) When the contract line item is established to refer to an exhibit or an attachment (if management needs dictate that a unit price be entered, the price shall be set forth in the item description block and enclosed in parentheses); or
(vi) When the contract is an indefinite delivery type contract and provides that the price of an item shall be determined at the time a delivery order is placed and the price is influenced by such factors as the quantity ordered (e.g., 10-99 @ $1.00, 100-249 @ $.98, 250+ @ $.95), the destination, the FOB point, or the type of packaging required.
(2) Separately identifiable. A contract line item must be identified separately from any other items or services on the contract.
(i) Supplies are separately identifiable if they have no more than one—
(A) National stock number (NSN);
(B) Item description; or
(C) Manufacturer's part number.
(ii) Services are separately identifiable if they have no more than one—
(A) Scope of work; or
(B) Description of services.
(iii) This requirement does not apply if there are associated subline items, established for other than informational reasons, and those subline items include the actual detailed identification in accordance with 204.7104 . Where this exception applies, use a general narrative description instead of the contract item description.
(3) Separate delivery schedule . Each contract line item or service shall have its own delivery schedule, period of performance, or completion date expressly stated (“as required” constitutes an expressly stated delivery term).
(i) The fact that there is more than one delivery date, destination, performance date, or performance point may be a determining factor in the decision as to whether to establish more than one contract line item.
(ii) If a contract line item has more than one destination or delivery date, the contracting officer may create individual contract line items for the different destinations or delivery dates, or may specify the different delivery dates for the units by destination in the delivery schedule.
(4) Single accounting classification citation .
(i) Each contract line item shall reference a single accounting classification citation except as provided in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this subsection.
(ii) The use of multiple accounting classification citations for a contract line item is authorized in the following situations:
(A) A single, nonseverable deliverable to be paid for with R&D or other funds properly incrementally obligated over several fiscal years in accordance with DoD policy;
(B) A single, nonseverable deliverable to be paid for with different authorizations or appropriations, such as in the acquisition of a satellite or the modification of production tooling used to produce items being acquired by several activities; or
(C) A modification to an existing contract line item for a nonseverable deliverable that results in the delivery of a modified item(s) where the item(s) and modification are to be paid for with different accounting classification citations.
(iii) When the use of multiple accounting classification citations is authorized for a single contract line item, establish informational subline items for each accounting classification citation in accordance with 204.7105 .
(b)  All subline items and exhibit line items under one contract line item shall be the same contract type as the contract line item.
(c)  For a contract that contains a combination of fixed-price line items, time-and-materials/labor-hour line items, and/or cost-reimbursement line items, identify the contract type for each contract line item in Section B, Supplies or Services and Prices/Costs, to facilitate appropriate payment.
(d)  Exhibits may be used as an alternative to putting a long list of contract line items in the schedule. If exhibits are used, create a contract line item citing the exhibit's identifier. See 204.7105 .
(e) If the contract involves a test model or a first article which must be approved, establish a separate contract line item or subline item for each item of supply or service which must be approved. If the test model or first article consists of a lot composed of a mixture of items, a single line item or subline item may be used for the lot.
(f) If a supply or service involves ancillary functions, like packaging and handling, transportation, payment of state or local taxes, or use of reusable containers, and these functions are normally performed by the contractor and the contractor is normally entitled to reimbursement for performing these functions, do not establish a separate contract line item solely to account for these functions. However, do identify the functions in the contract schedule. If the offeror separately prices these functions, contracting officers may establish separate contract line items for the functions; however, the separate line items must conform to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this subsection.
(g) Certain commercial items and initial provisioning spares for weapons systems are requested and subsequently solicited using units of measure such as kit, set, or lot. However, there are times when individual items within that kit, set, or lot are not grouped and delivered in a single shipment. This creates potential contract administration issues with inspection, acceptance, and payment. In such cases, solicitations should be structured to allow offerors to provide information about products that may not have been known to the Government prior to solicitation and propose an alternate line item structure as long as the alternate is consistent with the requirements of 204.71, which provides explicit guidance on the use of contract line items and subline items, and with PGI 204.71 .","['Contracts shall identify the items or services to be acquired as separate contract line items unless it is not feasible to do so.', '(a) Contract line items shall have all four of the following characteristics; however, there are exceptions within the characteristics, which may make establishing a separate contract line item appropriate even though one of the characteristics appears to be missing—', '(1) Single unit price .

204.7104-1,Criteria for establishing.,"Contract subline items provide flexibility to further identify elements within a contract line item for tracking performance or simplifying administration.  There are only two kinds of subline items:  those which are informational in nature and those which consist of more than one item that requires separate identification.
(a) Informational subline items.
(1)  This type of subline item identifies information that relates directly to the contract line item and is an integral part of it (e.g., parts of an assembly or parts of a kit).  These subline items shall not be scheduled separately for delivery, identified separately for shipment or performance, or priced separately for payment purposes.
(2)  The informational subline item may include quantities, prices, or amounts, if necessary to satisfy management requirements.  However, these elements shall be included within the item description in the supplies/services column and enclosed in parentheses to prevent confusing them with quantities, prices, or amounts that have contractual significance.  Do not enter these elements in the quantity and price columns.
(3)  Informational subline items shall be used to identify each accounting classification citation assigned to a single contract line item number when use of multiple citations is authorized (see 204.7103-1 (a)(4)(ii)).
(b) Separately identified subline items .
(1)  Subline items will be used instead of contract line items to facilitate payment, delivery tracking, contract funds accounting, or other management purposes.  Such subline items shall be used when items bought under one contract line item number—
(i)  Are to be paid for from more than one accounting classification.  A subline item shall be established for the quantity associated with the single accounting classification citation.  Establish a line item rather than a subline item if it is likely that a subline item may be assigned additional accounting classification citations at a later date.  Identify the funding as described in 204.7104-1 (a)(3);
(ii)  Are to be packaged in different sizes, each represented by its own NSN;
(iii)  Have collateral costs, such as packaging costs, but those costs are not a part of the unit price of the contract line item;
(iv)  Have different delivery dates or destinations or requisitions, or a combination of the three; or
(v)  Identify parts of an assembly or kit which—
(A)  Have to be separately identified at the time of shipment or performance; and
(B)  Are separately priced.
(2)  Each separately identified contract subline item shall have its own—
(i)  Delivery schedule, period of performance, or completion date;
(ii)  Unit price or single total price or amount (not separately priced (NSP) is acceptable as an entry for price or amount if the price is included in another subline item or a different contract line item).  This requirement does not apply—
(A)  If the subline item was created to refer to an exhibit or an attachment.  If management needs dictate that a unit price be entered, the price shall be set forth in the item description block of the schedule and enclosed in parentheses; or
(B)  In the case of indefinite delivery contracts described at 204.7103-1 (a)(1)(vi).
(iii)  Identification (e.g., NSN, item description, manufacturer's part number, scope of work, description of services).
(3)  Unit prices and extended amounts.
(i)  The unit price and total amount for all subline items may be entered at the contract line item number level if the unit price for the subline items is identical.  If there is any variation, the subline item unit prices shall be entered at the subline item level only.
(ii)  The unit price and extended amounts may be entered at the subline items level.
(iii)  The two methods in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section shall not be combined in a contract line item.
(iv)  When the price for items not separately priced is included in the price of another contract line or subline item, it may be necessary to withhold payment on the priced contract line or subline item until the included line or subline items that are not separately priced have been delivered.
