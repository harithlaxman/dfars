                <p id="p-7" data-page="55937">
                    DoD published a proposed rule in the 
                    <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                     at <a href="/citation/88-FR-6605" class="fr-reference" data-reference="88 FR 6605">88 FR 6605</a> on January 31, 2023, to implement section 803 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/117/public/81" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 117-81</a>). Section 803 modifies <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2380c" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2380c</a> (redesignated as <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/3458" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 3458</a>) to give DoD the authority to acquire innovative commercial products and commercial services through a competitive selection of proposals resulting from a general solicitation and the peer review of such proposals. Section 803 of the NDAA for FY 2022 also repealed section 879 of the NDAA for FY 2017, which authorized a pilot program providing the same authority for a limited period of time. In addition, section 814 of the NDAA for FY 2023 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/117/public/263" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 117-263</a>) amended <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/3458" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 3458</a> by striking &ldquo;fixed-price incentive fee contracts&rdquo; and inserting &ldquo;fixed-price incentive contracts&rdquo;. Therefore, this final rule incorporates this statutory amendment. One respondent submitted a public comment in response to the proposed rule.
                </p>
                <h2 id="h-8">II. Discussion and Analysis</h2>
                <p id="p-8" data-page="55937">DoD reviewed the public comment in the development of the final rule; however, no changes were made to the rule as a result of the comment received. A discussion of the comment and a summary of significant changes is provided, as follows:</p>
                <h3 id="h-9">A. Summary of Significant Changes From the Proposed Rule</h3>
                <p id="p-9" data-page="55937">Section 814 of the NDAA for FY 2023 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/117/public/263" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 117-263</a>) amended <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/3458" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">section 3458 of title 10, United States Code</a>, by striking &ldquo;fixed-price incentive fee contracts&rdquo; and inserting &ldquo;fixed-price incentive contracts&rdquo;. Therefore, this final rule amends DFARS 212.7002(b) to clarify the contract types that may be used in conjunction with a commercial solutions opening.</p>

                </p>
                <h3 id="h-11">C. Other Changes</h3>
                <p id="p-12" data-page="55937">This final rule removes the reference to section 803 of the NDAA for FY 2022 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/117/public/81" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 117-81</a>) at DFARS 212.7000, since the authority for commercial solutions openings is now codified at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/3458" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 3458</a>. The new DFARS section 203.104-1 is reformatted to reflect standard drafting conventions. The new paragraph at 206.102 is moved to new section 206.102-70 to reflect standard drafting conventions. In section 212.102 paragraph (a)(i)(B), the obsolete term &ldquo;commercial item determination&rdquo; is replaced with &ldquo;commercial product or commercial service determination.&rdquo; This change was included in the final rule for DFARS Case 2018-D066, published at <a href="/citation/88-FR-6578" class="fr-reference" data-reference="88 FR 6578">88 FR 6578</a> on January 31, 2023; however, the change was not made in the Code of Federal Regulations.</p>
                <h2 id="h-12">III. Applicability to Contracts at or Below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold, for Commercial Products Including Commercially Available Off-the-Shelf Items, and for Commercial Services</h2>
                <p id="p-13" data-page="55937">
                    This rule does not create any new solicitation provisions or contract clauses. It does not impact any existing solicitation provisions or contract clauses, or their applicability to contracts valued at or below the simplified acquisition threshold, for commercial products including commercially available off-the-shelf items, or for commercial services.

                </p>
                <h2 id="h-13">IV. Expected Impact of the Rule</h2>
                <p id="p-14" data-page="55938">This final rule implements the permanent statutory authorization for DoD to acquire innovative commercial products and commercial services through a competitive selection of proposals resulting from a general solicitation known as a commercial solutions opening and the peer review of such proposals in conjunction with a FAR part 12 contract. This rule is expected to impact the Government and large and small entities by simplifying solicitation, evaluation, and award procedures, which should decrease acquisition cost and, thus, be less burdensome for all parties. The use of a commercial solutions opening in conjunction with a FAR part 12 contract is also expected to benefit offerors and contractors as it will allow these entities to utilize existing commercial contracting procedures and operating systems, which decreases burden on both large and small entities. As a result, large and small entities may be more willing to enter into contracts with DoD. Therefore, DoD expects to benefit by having greater access to technologies not previously accessible.</p>
                <h2 id="h-14">V. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563</h2>
                <p id="p-15" data-page="55938">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under Section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993.</p>
                <h2 id="h-15">VI. Congressional Review Act</h2>
                <p id="p-16" data-page="55938">
                    As required by the Congressional Review Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/801" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 801-808</a>) before an interim or final rule takes effect, DoD will submit a copy of the interim or final rule with the form, Submission of Federal Rules under the Congressional Review Act, to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Comptroller General of the United States. A major rule under the Congressional Review Act cannot take effect until 60 days after it is published in the 
                    <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                    . The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has determined that this rule is not a major rule as defined by <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/804" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 804</a>.
                </p>

                    A final regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>, 
                    <em>et seq.</em>
                     and is summarized as follows:
                </p>
                <p id="p-18" data-page="55938">This final rule is necessary to implement section 803 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/117/public/81" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 117-81</a>) and section 814 of the NDAA for FY 2023 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/117/public/263" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 117-263</a>). Section 803 modifies <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2380c" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2380c</a> (redesignated as <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/3458" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 3458</a>) to permanently authorize DoD to acquire innovative commercial products and commercial services through a competitive selection of proposals resulting from a general solicitation, known as a commercial solutions opening (CSO), and the peer review of such proposals in conjunction with a FAR part 12 contract. Section 814 amends <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/3458" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 3458</a> to replace &ldquo;fixed-price incentive fee contracts&rdquo; with &ldquo;fixed-price incentive contracts&rdquo;. The objective of this rule is to implement the authority for DoD to obtain innovative solutions or potential capabilities to fulfill requirements, close capability gaps, or provide potential technological advancements that are new as of the date of submission of a proposal or that is a new application as of the date of submission of a proposal of a technology, process, or method existing as of such date. The use of a CSO with a FAR part 12 commercial contract is intended to bring new entrants into the DoD marketplace.</p>
                <p id="p-19" data-page="55938">No public comments were received in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis.</p>
                <p id="p-20" data-page="55938">Section 879 of the NDAA for FY 2017 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/114/public/328" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 114-328</a>) previously authorized a pilot program for the Defense CSO (the pilot), which was repealed by section 803 of the NDAA for FY 2022. According to data from the Federal Procurement Data System, during the pilot (FY 2018 to FY 2022), DoD awarded a total of 120 contracts as a result of CSOs, of which 82, or 68 percent, were awarded to a total of 72 unique small entities. During FYs 2020, 2021, and 2022, 19 unique small entities were awarded a contract resulting from a CSO each year. In addition, one unique small entity received such an award in FY 2018, and 14 unique small entities received such awards in FY 2019. This averages out to approximately 14 unique small entities receiving contracts resulting from a CSO during the last five FYs. Data from the System for Award Management revealed there were 330,704 small entities registered as of June 2023. However, since the use of a CSO with a FAR part 12 contract is intended to attract new entrants into the market, these numbers may not fully capture the number of small entities to which this rule may apply. Therefore, DoD cannot provide a more precise estimate of the number of small entities to which this rule may apply.</p>
                <p id="p-21" data-page="55938">This final rule does not impose any new reporting, recordkeeping, or other compliance requirements for small entities.</p>
                <p id="p-22" data-page="55938">DoD did not identify any significant alternatives that would minimize or reduce the significant economic impact on small entities, because there is no significant impact on small entities.</p>
