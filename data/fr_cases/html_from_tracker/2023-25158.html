The updated text at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/3452" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 3452(c)(3)</a> and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1906" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1906(c)(1)</a> is the same, except for the stated applicability in each of the statutes to either DoD or Federal Government contracts, respectively.</p>
                    <p id="p-13" data-page="80462">DoD reviewed the public comments in the development of the final rule.

                    <h3 id="h-9">A. Summary of Significant Changes From the Proposed Rule</h3>
                    <p id="p-14" data-page="80462">As noted in the introductory text of section II of this preamble, this final rule does not implement the changes in the proposed rule related to the definition of &ldquo;subcontract&rdquo; based on the updates at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/3452" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 3452(c)(3)</a>. Therefore, the comment to add the words &ldquo;or subcontractor at any tier&rdquo; at DFARS 212.001 in the definition of &ldquo;subcontract&rdquo; in paragraph (2), and in the clauses that include this definition, to clarify that the agreements exclusion applies to subcontractors at any tier, will be considered under the new DFARS Case 2023-D022, Definition of Subcontract. One change was made to add a sentence at DFARS 212.301, paragraph (f), to clarify the prohibition of the use of FAR and DFARS solicitation provisions and contract clauses by the contracting officer, where not required by the FAR or DFARS or consistent with customary commercial practices.</p>

                         In addition to this DFARS Case 2017-D010, there are other FAR and DFARS cases related to commercial contracts that are in process (FAR Cases 2018-013 and 2018-006; and DFARS Cases 2018-D074 and 2023-D022). FAR Case 2018-018, published at <a href="/citation/86-FR-61017" class="fr-reference" data-reference="86 FR 61017">86 FR 61017</a> (November 4, 2021), implemented section 836 of the NDAA for FY 2019 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/115/public/232" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 115-232</a>) that revised <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/103" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 103</a> to amend the definition of &ldquo;commercial item&rdquo; in the FAR. DFARS case 2018-D066, published at <a href="/citation/88-FR-6578" class="fr-reference" data-reference="88 FR 6578">88 FR 6578</a> (January 31, 2023), also implemented section 836 of the NDAA for FY 2019 in the DFARS to make similar changes to the term &ldquo;commercial item&rdquo;, as well as implementing sections 837(b) and (c) of the NDAA for FY 2019. Section 836 amended the definition of &ldquo;commercial item&rdquo;; and section 837(b) and (c) made conforming changes at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2533a" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2533a</a> and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2533b" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2533b</a>, now <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/4862" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 4862</a> and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/4863" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4863</a>, respectively. Under this rulemaking (DFARS Case 2017-D010), DoD reviewed DFARS clauses as directed under section 874 of the NDAA for FY 2017. Section 874 limits the required review of the applicability of provisions of law and contract clauses to prime contracts for commercial products (including COTS items) and commercial services to those provisions of law and contract clauses enacted after January 1, 2015. DFARS Case 2018-D074 will include a review of DFARS clauses for applicability of provisions of law and contract clauses to prime contracts for commercial products (including COTS items) and commercial services for those provisions of law and contract clauses enacted after October 13, 1994.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent stated that the DFARS should be amended to prohibit the use of DFARS provisions and clauses unless consistent with customary commercial practice or approved in accordance with FAR 12.302. The respondent also recommended the SF 1449 block 10 be revised so as to not confuse contracting officers due to the elimination of applicability of DFARS 252.219-7010, Notification of Competition Limited to Eligible 8(a) Participants&mdash;Partnership Agreement, to commercial item contracts.

                         The proposed rule text has been revised to clarify at DFARS 212.301(f) that the use of provisions and clauses other than the DFARS part 212 provisions and clauses by the contracting officer is prohibited unless required by the FAR or DFARS or unless consistent with customary commercial practices.

                        clauses to contracts and subcontracts for the acquisition of commercial products, commercial services, and commercially available off-the-shelf items, is amended to remove 252.219-7010 from the proposed rule text. DFARS 219.811-3, paragraph (2), is amended to state that 252.219-7010 is used in solicitations and contracts, including those using FAR part 12 procedures for commercial products and commercial services, when using the competitive 8(a) procedures of FAR 19.805. This is necessary for DoD procurements of commercial products and commercial services that have been accepted by the Small Business Administration for competition under the 8(a) program.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         Three respondents stated that the proposed rule should prohibit flowing down clauses to subcontracts by contractors (and higher-tier subcontractors). One respondent stated that the FAR should be amended to delete the language at FAR 52.244-6(c)(2) and should be amended to limit flowdown only to clauses that specifically require flowdown to subcontracts for commercial items with a prohibition on flowing down any additional clauses. Another respondent recommended that DoD bar contractors from wholesale flowdown of clauses. Another respondent stated that it is unclear what ramifications there will be if a FAR or DFARS clause is improperly flowed down.

                        <em>Response:</em>
                         This final rule prohibits flowing down FAR or DFARS clauses by the prime contractor, under certain conditions, under DFARS clause 252.244-7000, Subcontracts for Commercial Products or Commercial Services. Also, the rule prohibits flowing down FAR or DFARS provisions and clauses by higher-tier subcontractors, under certain conditions, as DFARS clause 252.244-7000 has a flowdown requirement. The ramifications of improperly flowing down FAR or DFARS clauses would be determined in accordance with the terms of the contract.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         Several respondents commented on the definitions of &ldquo;subcontract&rdquo; and &ldquo;subcontractor.&rdquo; One respondent stated that the DFARS definitions of &ldquo;subcontract&rdquo; and &ldquo;subcontractor&rdquo; should be consistent with the FAR definitions and that the term &ldquo;similar contractual instrument&rdquo; should be defined. Two respondents stated that the proposed rule should rephrase the language regarding the exclusion from agreements that are &ldquo;not identifiable to any particular contract&rdquo;, as the term &ldquo;identifiable&rdquo; may be ambiguous. One respondent stated the language should be changed to state there is an exclusion from agreements &ldquo;not identified to any particular contract under the contractor's disclosed (if applicable) or otherwise established business practices.&rdquo; A respondent stated that the terms &ldquo;multiple contracts&rdquo; and &ldquo;other parties&rdquo; need clarity. Two respondents stated the exclusion should be modified to clarify that it excludes contractor agreements at any level of the supply chain. One respondent stated the definition of subcontract in the proposed rule text will exclude agreements that would benefit from the flowdown of DFARS 252.225-7009, Restriction on Acquisition of Certain Articles Containing Specialty Metals, and DFARS 252.225-7012, Preference for Certain Domestic Commodities, and recommended those clauses be amended to include language that removes the exclusion in the definition of &ldquo;subcontract.&rdquo; Three respondents stated that the term &ldquo;commodities&rdquo; should be defined. One respondent stated that the definition of &ldquo;subcontract&rdquo; should be moved from DFARS 212.001 to DFARS 244.101 to avoid limiting application of this definition to DFARS part 212 clauses.

                         DoD agrees that the DFARS definitions of &ldquo;subcontract&rdquo; and &ldquo;subcontractor&rdquo; should be consistent with the FAR definitions. Therefore, DoD has initiated a separate DFARS Case 2023-D022 to implement the definition of &ldquo;subcontract&rdquo; in the DFARS to facilitate alignment with the proposed rule for FAR case 2018-006. The DFARS generally relies on the FAR definitions of &ldquo;subcontract&rdquo; and &ldquo;subcontractor.&rdquo;. The statutory language of <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/3452" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 3452(c)(3)</a> is limited to DoD; however, FAR case 2018-006 will amend the definition of &ldquo;subcontract&rdquo; in the FAR to implement similar statutory language at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1906" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1906(c)(1)</a>.

                         One respondent stated that the proposed rule should be made to apply to existing DoD contracts and subcontracts.

                         Contracting officers may use their discretion to apply this final rule to existing contracts; however, they are not required to do so. See FAR 1.108(d).

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent stated that when COTS products are provided under services contracts, as well as services primarily for the installation and maintenance of COTS products, those subcontracts should also be excluded from flowdown obligations that are excluded from COTS item subcontracts. One respondent stated that none of the &ldquo;best interest&rdquo; determinations made in this rule adequately consider existing standard commercial practice and recommended publishing the determinations. Two respondents stated that the proposed rule impacts the environment.

                        <em>Response:</em>
                         These comments are outside the scope of this rule. A commercial subcontract for services that delivers the installation and maintenance of COTS items is a contract for commercial services and not a contract for COTS items. The only way to extend a COTS item exclusion would be to change the definition of COTS item to include services that deliver the installation and maintenance of COTS products, which is outside the scope of this rule. The applicability of DFARS clauses to commercial contracts and commercial subcontracts that do not have an exemption from inapplicability at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/3452" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 3452</a> (e)(1), (e)(2), or (e)(3), is being reviewed under DFARS case

This change is a result of the final rule for DFARS Case 2022-D018, Reorganization of Defense Acquisition Statutes, published at <a href="/citation/87-FR-76988" class="fr-reference" data-reference="87 FR 76988">87 FR 76988</a> on December 16, 2022, which implemented the transfer and reorganization of the defense acquisition statutes.</p>

                    <p id="p-32" data-page="80464">This final rule does not create any new solicitation provisions or contract clauses. It does not impact any existing solicitation provisions or contract clauses or their applicability to contracts valued at or below the simplified acquisition threshold, for commercial products including COTS items, or for commercial services.</p>
                    <h2 id="h-21">IV. Expected Impact of the Rule</h2>
                    <p id="p-33" data-page="80464">This rule may impact any business, large or small, that is awarded a commercial contract by DoD. The rule does not add any new solicitation provisions or contract clauses. Rather, there may be a reduction in burden on contractors by the creation of two new sections in the DFARS that list solicitation provisions and contract clauses that are inapplicable to solicitations and contracts for commercial products, commercial services, and COTS items.</p>
                    <h2 id="h-22">V. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563</h2>
                    <p id="p-34" data-page="80464">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, as amended.</p>

A major rule under the Congressional Review Act cannot take effect until 60 days after it is published in the 
                        <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                        . The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has determined that this rule is not a major rule as defined by <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/804" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 804</a>.

                         and is summarized as follows:
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-37" data-page="80464">This final rule is required in order to implement part of section 874 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2017. Section 874 amended <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2375" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2375</a>, redesignated as <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/3452" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 3452</a>, and required certain changes to the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS).</p>
                    <p id="p-38" data-page="80464">The objective of the final rule is to partially implement section 874 of the NDAA for FY 2017 to address the applicability of Defense-unique statutes to contracts and subcontracts for commercial products, commercial services, and commercially available off-the-shelf items.</p>
                    <p id="p-39" data-page="80464">There were no significant issues raised by the public comments in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis.</p>
                    <p id="p-40" data-page="80464">DoD obtained data from the Federal Procurement Data System for contracts that were awarded in FY 2020 through FY 2022 using FAR part 12 procedures for the acquisition of commercial products and commercial services and that exceeded the micro-purchase threshold. The data indicate that DoD awarded this type of contract to approximately 13,952 unique small entities per year. DoD estimates there may be approximately twice that number of small entities receiving subcontracts for commercial products and commercial services. Any reductions in the applicability of solicitation provisions and contract clauses to contracts and subcontracts for the acquisition of commercial products and commercial services may be beneficial to these small entities.</p>
                    <p id="p-41" data-page="80464">This final rule does not include any new projected reporting, recordkeeping, or other compliance requirements for small entities.</p>
                    <p id="p-42" data-page="80464">DoD did not identify any significant alternatives that would minimize or reduce the impact on small entities while accomplishing the stated objectives of the applicable statute.</p>

                    <p id="p-43" data-page="80464">The final rule does not contain any information collection requirements that require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/44/3501" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44 U.S.C. chapter 35</a>).</p>
