                <h2 id="h-7">I. Background</h2>
                <p id="p-7" data-page="34528">DoD is amending the DFARS to implement section 861 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/116/public/92" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 116-92</a>). Section 861 amends section 808 of the NDAA for FY 2000 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/106/public/398" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 106-398</a>) by removing the requirement for contracting professionals to have completed at least 24 semester credit hours (or equivalent) of study from an accredited institution of higher education in the areas of accounting, business, finance, law, contracts, purchasing, economics, industrial management, marketing, quantitative methods, and organization, and management. The qualification requirement, implemented at Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations Supplement (DFARS) 201.603-2(1)(iii)(B) and 218.201(1), is removed by this final rule in accordance with section 861. The title to DoD Instruction 5000.66 is also updated to read &ldquo;Defense Acquisition Workforce Education, Training, Experience, and Career Development Program&rdquo; at DFARS 201.603-2(2)(iii).</p>
                <h2 id="h-8">II. Applicability to Contracts at or Below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold and for Commercial Items, Including Commercially Available Off-the-Shelf Items</h2>
                <p id="p-8" data-page="34528">This rule only impacts the internal operating procedures of DoD. As such, the rule does not impose any new requirements on contracts at or below the simplified acquisition threshold or for commercial items, including commercially available off-the-shelf items.</p>
                <h2 id="h-9">III. Publication of This Final Rule for Public Comment Is Not Required by Statute</h2>
                <p id="p-9" data-page="34528">The statute that applies to the publication of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) is Office of Federal Procurement Policy statute (codified at title 41 of the United States Code). Specifically, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1707" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1707(a)(1)</a> requires that a procurement policy, regulation, procedure, or form (including an amendment or modification thereof) must be published for public comment if it relates to the expenditure of appropriated funds, and has either a significant effect beyond the internal operating procedures of the agency issuing the policy, regulation, procedure, or form, or has a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors. This final rule is not required to be published for public comment, because it only impacts processes that are internal to DoD.</p>
                <h2 id="h-10">IV. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563</h2>
                <p id="p-10" data-page="34528">Executive Order (E.O.) 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review; and <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a>, Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review, direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. The Office of Management and Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, has determined that this is not a significant regulatory action as defined under section 3(f) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a> and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b). This rule is not a major rule as defined at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/804" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 804(2)</a>.</p>
                <h2 id="h-11">V. <a href="/executive-order/13771" class="eo">Executive Order 13771</a>
</h2>
                <p id="p-11" data-page="34528">This rule is not subject to an <a href="/executive-order/13771" class="eo">E.O. 13771</a>, because this rule is not a significant regulatory action under <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>.</p>
                <h2 id="h-12">VI. Regulatory Flexibility Act</h2>
                <p id="p-12" data-page="34528">
                    Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment are not required to be given for this rule under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1707" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1707(a)(1)</a> (see section III. of this preamble), the analytical requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a> 
                    <em>et seq.</em>) are not applicable. Accordingly, no regulatory flexibility analysis is required, and none has been prepared.
                </p>
                <h2 id="h-13">VII. Paperwork Reduction Act</h2>
                <p id="p-13" data-page="34528">The rule does not contain any information collection requirements that require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/44/3501" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44 U.S.C. chapter 35</a>).</p>
