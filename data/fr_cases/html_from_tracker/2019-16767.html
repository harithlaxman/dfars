                <p id="p-6" data-page="39203">
                    This final rule partially implements section 876 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/114/public/328" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 114-328</a>). Section 876 requires revision of the guidance issued pursuant to section 855 of the NDAA for FY 2016 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/114/public/92" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 114-92</a>) (final DFARS rule published in the 
                    <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                     under DFARS Case 2016-D006 on January 31, 2018 (<a href="/citation/83-FR-4431" class="fr-reference" data-reference="83 FR 4431">83 FR 4431</a>)) to provide a preference for certain commercial services, unless the appropriate official determines in writing that no commercial items are suitable to meet the agency's needs. Different approval levels are provided for contracts in excess of $10 million, and contracts that exceed the simplified acquisition threshold but do not exceed $10 million. This rule addresses facilities-related services, knowledge-based services (except engineering services), medical services, and transportation services. Construction services are being addressed under DFARS Case 2019-D034.
                </p>
                <h2 id="h-8">II. Discussion and Analysis</h2>
                <p id="p-7" data-page="39203">The requirements of section 876 have been implemented by adding a new DFARS section 212.272, Preference for certain commercial products and services. A cross-reference to the new section has been added in part 237, Service Contracting, at DFARS 237.102. Also provided in the new DFARS section 212.272, is a cross-reference to the implementation of section 856 of the NDAA for FY 2016 at DFARS 239.101 related to the acquisition of information technology products and services.</p>
                <h2 id="h-9">III. Publication of This Final Rule for Public Comment Is Not Required by Statute</h2>
                <p id="p-8" data-page="39203">The statute that applies to the publication of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) is <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1707" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1707</a> entitled &ldquo;Publication of Proposed Regulations.&rdquo; Paragraph (a)(1) of the statute requires that a procurement policy, regulation, procedure or form (including an amendment or modification thereof) must be published for public comment if it relates to the expenditure of appropriated funds, and has either a significant effect beyond the internal operating procedures of the agency issuing the policy, regulation, procedure or form, or has a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors. This final rule is not required to be published for public comment, because it only specifies the approval process if acquiring certain noncommercial services. These requirements affect only the internal operating procedures of the Government.</p>

                <h2 id="h-11">V. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563</h2>
                <p id="p-10" data-page="39203">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993.

                    Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment are not required to be given for this rule under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1707" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1707(a)(1)</a> (see section III. of this preamble), the analytical requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>
