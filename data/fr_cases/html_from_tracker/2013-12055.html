L. 111-84</a>), enacted October 28, 2009. Section 821 provides authority for certain types of Government support contractors to have access to proprietary technical data belonging to prime contractors and other third parties, provided that the technical data owner may require the support contractor to execute a non-disclosure agreement having certain restrictions and remedies.

Section 2320 establishes the basic allocation of rights in technical data, and provides, among other things, that a private party is entitled to restrict the Government's rights to release or disclose privately developed technical data outside the Government. This restriction is implemented in the DFARS as the &ldquo;limited rights&rdquo; license, which essentially limits the Government's use of such data only for in-house use and which does not include release to Government support contractors.</p>
                <p id="p-9" data-page="30233">Historically, the statutorily based scheme has included only two categorical exceptions to the basic nondisclosure requirements for such privately developed data:</p>

                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     Two respondents suggested that proprietary information should not be disclosed to support contractors until after the owner is given notice an NDA is executed. The respondents stated that if the Government allows access to the proprietary information without an NDA in place, then the proprietary information owner &ldquo;loses the opportunity to enforce its rights&rdquo; and the covered Government support contractor would no longer be motivated to enter into an NDA.

                    <em>DoD Response:</em>
                     A covered Government support contractor may not receive access to proprietary information in the absence of appropriate legally binding non-disclosure obligations. The Government's contract with a covered Government support contractor must always contain the clause at 252.227-7025, which places legally binding use and non-disclosure restrictions on the covered Government support contractor before it has access to any proprietary information. In addition, 252.227-7025(c) expressly confirms that the owner of the proprietary information is a third-party beneficiary of those use and non-disclosure obligations and has a direct cause of action against the covered Government support contractor for any breach of those obligations. Thus, the covered Government support contractor cannot receive any such proprietary information unless and until it is already subject to, at a minimum, the legally binding use and nondisclosure obligations of the clause at 252.227-7025, which also subjects the covered Government support contractor to a direct cause of action by the proprietary information owner.

                <p id="p-20" data-page="30234">
                    <em>DoD Response:</em>
                     The Use and Non-Disclosure Agreement at 227.7103-7 is an agreement between the Government and a private party, and is used only when the information is being provided to the private party outside of a contract that contains the clause at 252.227-7025. When the receiving party is a covered Government support contractor, then, by definition, the contract under which the information is being provided must contain the clause at 252.227-7025&mdash;or else the receiving contractor cannot qualify as a covered Government support contractor and would not be authorized to receive the proprietary information for that contract performance. Thus, in these cases, the clause at 252.227-7025 is already applicable and the NDA at 227.7103-7 is not to be used. Moreover, the 227.7103-7 NDA would be insufficient because it does not address the specialized restrictions for covered Government support contractors&mdash;because those restrictions are fully implemented in the clause at 252.227-7025, which must be in the contract in order for the recipient to qualify to receive the information as a covered Government support contractor.

                <p id="p-21" data-page="30234">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     Two respondents suggested that the requirement, in the NDA between the contractor and the covered Government support contractor, prohibiting any additional terms and conditions over those present in 252.227-7025 without mutual agreement of the parties, would cause covered Government support contractors to &ldquo;balk&rdquo; at signing industry standard NDAs which most often include terms and conditions that are not included in 252.227-7025, and that the restrictions set forth in the clause &ldquo;do not make a legally sufficient document&rdquo;. The respondents suggested removing the prohibition by providing language allowing additional terms and conditions.
                </p>
                <p id="p-22" data-page="30234">One respondent also noted that an example of a restriction that is not included in the clause at 252.227-7025 but that is &ldquo;particularly important for enforcement&rdquo; of the proprietary information owner's rights, would be a requirement for the covered Government support contractor to have its employees sign individual NDAs containing materially similar terms.</p>
                <p id="p-23" data-page="30234">
                    <em>DoD Response:</em>
                     Regarding the legal sufficiency and effect of 252.227-7025, that clause unequivocally establishes a legally sufficient and binding obligation on the recipient of the information, which expressly includes all of the restrictions provided in the statutory language, and which expressly affirms that the proprietary information owner is a third-party beneficiary of those clause obligations and thereby has a direct cause of action against the recipient of the proprietary information for any breach of those obligations. Additionally, the clause at 252.227-7025 requires that any such direct NDA between the covered Government support contractor and the proprietary information owner will &ldquo;implement&rdquo; the requirements of the clause at 252.227-7025, which would require, at a minimum, terms and conditions that are necessary to establish a legally sufficient NDA that covers all of the restrictions and obligations contained in the clause at 252.227-7025. Beyond those minimums, the parties are also free to negotiate for any additional terms and conditions by mutual agreement, but neither party can require the other to agree to a term or condition that is outside of those necessary to implement the 252.227-7025 requirements (which fully implement the statutory requirements).
                </p>
                <p id="p-24" data-page="30234">DoD agrees with the respondent's suggestion that it is important to require the covered Government support contractor to ensure that its employees are subject to appropriate non-disclosure obligations, and observes that the obligations on the recipient contractor in the clause at 252.227-7025 do, in fact, create an obligation for that contractor to ensure that it implements the use and nondisclosure restrictions appropriately in the performance of its contractual duties, which would necessarily include ensuring that its employees who will have access or use of the proprietary information are subject to the applicable use and nondisclosure restrictions. However, to the extent that this may be viewed as an implicit obligation of the clause at 252.227-7025, and thus potentially could be overlooked or less than fully understood, such ambiguity must be eliminated. Accordingly, DoD has added a new paragraph (d) to 252.227-7025 to explicitly require the recipient contractor to ensure that its employees are subject to use and non-disclosure obligations prior to the employees being provided access to or use of the proprietary information.</p>

                <p id="p-25" data-page="30234">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     One respondent suggested that DoD's Performance Assessments and Root Cause Analysis (PARCA) activities related to utilizing a &ldquo;master NDA&rdquo; between the Government and support contractors to cover third-party proprietary earned value management data (wherein the data owner is a third-party beneficiary of the master NDA) may be inconsistent with the approach in this rule (i.e., which provides for individual &ldquo;direct&rdquo; NDAs between the support contractor and the proprietary information owner), and recommends internal DoD coordination to eliminate inconsistencies. The respondent acknowledged that although such earned value management data largely involves &ldquo;proprietary financial, business, and contract performance data and not Limited Rights Technical Data or Restricted Rights Software, it would be most beneficial to ensure consistency in the processes for disclosing both types of data.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p id="p-26" data-page="30234">
                    <em>DoD Response:</em>
                     This rule requires the use of the clause at 252.227-7025 with all covered Government support contractors, which serves as a form of &ldquo;master NDA&rdquo; between the Government and the support contractor, in which the proprietary information owner is a third-party beneficiary of that NDA and thereby has a direct cause of action against the support contractor for any breach of the NDA requirements. However, as noted by the respondent, earned value management data does not include limited rights technical data or restricted rights computer software, and thus the PARCA efforts are outside the scope of this rule, as well as the underlying statutory obligations regarding a direct NDA between a covered Government support contractor and the proprietary information owner.

                    <em>DoD Response:</em>
                     These conditions are present in, and applied to all covered Government support contractors, at paragraph (b)(5) of 252.227-7025, which is a required clause for all contracts when it is anticipated that the Government will provide the contractor, for performance of its contract, technical data marked with another contractor's restrictive legend(s) (see clause prescriptions at 227.7103-6 (c), 227.7104(f)(1) and 227.7203-6(d)). A support contractor cannot qualify as a covered Government support contractor unless it meets the definition of a &ldquo;covered Government support contractor,&rdquo; which requires that the clause at 252.227-7025 be included in the covered Government support contractor's contract and thereby applies all of the cited restrictions to the covered Government support contractor's use of the relevant data or software to perform that contract. This structure was used to include the substance of the applicable use and release conditions within the clause that serves to apply the restrictions to contractors of any and all types, including covered Government support contractors that are receiving such Government-furnished information (GFI). Thus, these restrictions are included in the definition of &ldquo;covered Government support contractor&rdquo; by cross-reference.

                     One respondent suggested that the rule should clarify the access and use restrictions on a covered Government support contractor by expressly citing the statutory purpose limitation of &ldquo;for the sole purpose of furnishing independent and impartial advice or technical assistance directly to the Government in support of the Government's management and oversight of the program or effort to which such [proprietary information] relates&rdquo; in the definitions of &ldquo;limited rights&rdquo; and &ldquo;restricted rights&rdquo; at DFARS 252.227-7013(a)(14)(i)(B)(

                     The statutory purpose restrictions on the covered Government support contractor's access and use of such proprietary information are expressly incorporated at 252.227-7025(b)(5)(i) into the access and use restrictions on a covered Government support contractor for limited rights technical data and restricted rights computer software, and also for technical data related to commercial items.

Thus no further revisions are necessary. This structure was used to include the substance of the applicable use and release conditions within the clause that serves to apply the restrictions to the covered Government support contractors.</p>

                     One respondent noted that the rule covers situations in which a covered Government support contractor could be in competition with a contractor-owner of proprietary data by prohibiting the support contractor from using that data to compete for any contracts, but this does not cover a support contractor that may not be considered to be in competition, but that would have access to such proprietary information in the course of advising the Government on overall acquisition strategies. The respondent recommends that the rule be revised to specifically prohibit such a support contractor from using the data to advise the Government on acquisition strategies or overall strategies in way that would benefit the support contractor.

                     Independently of this rule, the organizational conflict of interest rules restrict a support contractor, including a covered Government support contractor, from advising the Government on acquisition strategies or overall strategies, or any other matter, in which the support contractor would have a financial or other interest (i.e., that would qualify as an organizational conflict of interest). Those prohibitions and restrictions apply regardless of whether the advising support contractor would have access to any third party proprietary data in the course of such advising. This rule supplements those existing organizational conflict of interest restrictions by adding layers of restriction, and additional safeguards, to ensure that any covered Government support contractor's access to a third party proprietary data does not result in any competitive harm to the third party data owner.

                    <em>DoD Response:</em>
                     The prohibition against covered Government support contractors having affiliations with the prime and first-tier subcontractors is a substantive limitation from the statutory definition of &ldquo;covered Government support contractor.&rdquo; Changing the scope of the definition to prohibit affiliations at lower tiers would narrow the scope of the definition of &ldquo;covered Government support contractor&rdquo; in a manner that is inconsistent with the statute. The statutory scheme permits affiliations at lower tiers, but established numerous restrictions and protections to ensure that the covered Government support contractor's access to proprietary information does not result in competitive harm. This scheme is reinforced in all cases by the rules and restrictions against organizational conflicts of interest. Thus, a support contractor with affiliations at lower tiers may still qualify as a covered Government support contractor if it meets all other definitional criteria (see 252.227-7013(a)(5), 252.227-7014(a)(6), 252.227-7015(a)(2), and 252.227-7018(a)(6)), but in all such cases the covered Government support contractor would be subject to the obligations regarding direct NDAs (see 252.227-7025(b)(1)(ii)(D), (b)(4)(ii)(D), and (d)). If a support contractor is not covered by the rule (i.e., does not meet the definition of &ldquo;covered Government support contractor&rdquo;), then that support contractor would not be subject to that direct NDA requirement, but that is because the support contractor would not be authorized to receive the proprietary information as a covered Government support contractor in the first place. It is impossible under this rule for a covered Government support contractor to be authorized to receive such proprietary information and not to be subject to the obligations regarding direct NDAs.

Section 821 provides authority for certain types of Government support contractors to have access to proprietary technical data belonging to prime contractors and other third parties, provided that the technical data owner may require the support contractor to execute a non-disclosure agreement having certain restrictions and remedies.</p>
                <p id="p-59" data-page="30237">No public comments were received in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis.</p>
                <p id="p-60" data-page="30237">No comments were received from the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration in response to the rule. The rule affects small businesses that are Government support contractors that need access to proprietary technical data or computer software belonging to prime contractors and other third parties. It will also affect any small business that is the owner of &ldquo;limited rights&rdquo; technical data or restricted rights computer software in the possession of the Government to which the support contractor will require access.</p>
                <p id="p-61" data-page="30237">The rule imposes no reporting, recordkeeping, or other information collection requirements. However, the statute provides that the support contractor must be willing to sign a nondisclosure agreement with the owner of the data. The rule has implemented this requirement in a way that preserves maximum flexibility for the private parties to reach mutual agreement without unnecessary interference from the Government. To reduce burdens, the rule permits the owner of the data to waive the requirement for a nondisclosure agreement, since the Government clauses already adequately deal with non-disclosure. Further, the rule provides that the support contractors cannot be required to agree to any conditions not required by statute. In the final rule, DoD has deleted the requirement to provide a copy of the non-disclosure agreement or waiver to the contracting officer, upon request.</p>
                <p id="p-62" data-page="30237">Other than the alternatives already addressed, there are no known significant alternatives to the rule that would meet the requirements of the statute and minimize any significant economic impact of the rule on small entities. The impact of this rule on small business is not expected to be significant because the execution of a non-disclosure agreement is not likely to have a significant cost or administrative impact.</p>
