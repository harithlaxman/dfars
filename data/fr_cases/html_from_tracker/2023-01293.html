                    <p id="p-6" data-page="6597">
                        DoD published a proposed rule in the 
                        <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                         at <a href="/citation/86-FR-53927" class="fr-reference" data-reference="86 FR 53927">86 FR 53927</a> on September 29, 2021, to implement section 824 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/114/public/328" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 114-328</a>). Section 824 amends <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2372" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2372</a> (redesignated as <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/3762" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 3762</a>) to require that regulations may not infringe on the independence of a contractor to choose which technologies to pursue in its independent research and development (IR&amp;D) program if the chief executive officer (CEO) of the contractor determines that IR&amp;D expenditures will advance the needs of the Department of Defense for future technology and advanced capability. Section 824 also decouples IR&amp;D and bid and proposal (B&amp;P) costs by moving the language pertaining to B&amp;P costs out of <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2372" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2372</a> and placing it in the new <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2372a" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2372a</a> (redesignated as <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/3763" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 3763</a>). This change ensures that regulations pertaining to B&amp;P costs are separated from regulations pertaining to IR&amp;D costs. Five respondents submitted public comments in response to the proposed rule.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         Several respondents commented on the requirement in the proposed rule for certain contractors to submit a statement that the contractor's CEO determined that the company's IR&amp;D expenditures will advance the needs of DoD for future technology and advanced capability. In particular, one respondent commented that the statute does not actually require CEOs to make IR&amp;D determinations as stated in the proposed rule. Two respondents commented that the submission requirement would likely overburden small businesses or nontraditional defense contractors. One respondent commented that the proposed rule lacks submission guidance for contractors that are not major contractors. One respondent expressed concern that IR&amp;D cost allowability under the proposed rule might arbitrarily hinge on the form and manner of submission of the CEO determination rather than its substance.

                        <em>Response:</em>
                         DoD removed the requirement to submit a statement regarding CEO determinations from the final rule. DoD reviewed the statute and agreed that this requirement should be removed. Further, by removing the requirement to submit a statement regarding CEO determinations, the final rule does not tie cost allowability to submission of an affirmative statement regarding the CEO determination.

                         One respondent commented that the phrase &ldquo;advance the needs of DoD for future technology and advanced capability&rdquo; is undefined in the proposed rule despite being the criterion for IR&amp;D cost allowability when reflected in a CEO determination. Several respondents commented variously that this criterion for cost allowability is impractical, ambiguous, subjective, or potentially restrictive.

                         The statute explicitly relates the CEO determination to DoD's communication of areas of need. Therefore, the language is retained in the final rule.

                         Several respondents commented on the clause at 252.242-70XX in the proposed rule as well as the clause prescription. In particular, a few respondents commented that the DCAA reporting requirement reflected in statute, which is the basis for the proposed clause, is unnecessary because the information is already available and reported to the Government in contractor annual Final Indirect Cost Rate Proposals when required by FAR 52.216-7. A few respondents commented that the clause prescription appears overly broad. Several respondents commented that the reporting period covered by the clause should reflect the contractor's fiscal year rather than the Government's fiscal year. One respondent expressed concern that information submitted as required by the clause might be used for improper purposes. One respondent commented that the clause does not provide guidance to contractors that did not expend any IR&amp;D funds. One respondent commented that the clause does not provide guidance regarding submission of classified information.

                         DoD removed the proposed clause at 252.242-70XX and its prescription from the final rule, because the proposed clause is not necessary for the Government to obtain the information required by statute.

                         DoD amended the final rule to avoid retroactive application. In particular, DoD deleted proposed-rule language that required contractor action for IR&amp;D projects beginning on or after October 1, 2017.

                         Several respondents suggested the CEO's authority to make determinations &ldquo;that expenditures will advance the needs of the Department of Defense for future technology and advanced capability&rdquo; should be explicitly delegable in the final rule.

                         One respondent suggested that allowability of a contractor's IR&amp;D costs could hinge on whether the contractor has an approved accounting system within the meaning of DFARS 252.242-7006, Accounting System Administration.

                        <em>Response:</em>
                         The Government retains the responsibility for making appropriate inquiries into the reasonableness of the costs submitted, even if an approved accounting system would presumably satisfy the requirement for allowability of cost. Such inquiries must follow routine audit procedures. Therefore, there is no need for changes to the rule based on this comment.

                         One respondent commented that use of the word &ldquo;will&rdquo; in the proposed rule regarding the CEO determination is impractical because the word &ldquo;will&rdquo; connotes knowledge of future outcomes, which is necessarily uncertain.

                        <em>et seq.</em>
                         and is summarized as follows:
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-50" data-page="6599">This rule implements section 824 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/114/public/328" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 114-328</a>). Section 824 amended <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2372" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2372</a> (redesignated as <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/3762" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 3762</a>) to require that regulations may not infringe on the independence of a contractor to choose which technologies to pursue in its independent research and development (IR&amp;D) program if the chief executive officer (CEO) of the contractor determines that IR&amp;D expenditures will advance the needs of the Department of Defense for future technology and advanced capability. Section 824 also decouples IR&amp;D and bid and proposal (B&amp;P) costs by moving the language pertaining to B&amp;P costs out of <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2372" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2372</a> and placing it in the new <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2372a" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2372a</a> (redesignated as <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/3763" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 3763</a>). This change ensures that regulations pertaining to B&amp;P costs are separated from regulations pertaining to IR&amp;D costs.</p>
                    <p id="p-51" data-page="6599">One respondent challenged the statement in the initial regulatory flexibility analysis that &ldquo;DoD expects a minimal number of the contractors [required to submit statements regarding CEO determinations] to be small entities&rdquo; given that &ldquo;DoD does not have a list of other than major contractors or small entities that have IR&amp;D programs.&rdquo; The requirement is removed from the final rule for major contractors to include a statement in the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) submission that the CEO of the contractor made the determination required by <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2372" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2372</a>.</p>
                    <p id="p-52" data-page="6599">The final rule will only apply to small businesses that have incurred IR&amp;D costs or B&amp;P costs associated with noncommercial DoD awards exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold or small businesses that have an IR&amp;D program and are considered to be a major contractor, which is defined as having annual expenditures of $11 million in combined IR&amp;D and B&amp;P expenditures.</p>
                    <p id="p-53" data-page="6599">DoD does not maintain a list of other than major contractors or small businesses that have IR&amp;D programs. Based on an internal DoD website, 31 contractors have historically made 99 percent of the submissions of IR&amp;D activities into the relevant DTIC website. DoD therefore expects the final rule will have minimal impact on small businesses.</p>
                    <p id="p-54" data-page="6599">This rule includes no new projected reporting, recordkeeping, or other compliance requirements.</p>
                    <p id="p-55" data-page="6599">There are no known significant alternative approaches to the final rule that would meet the requirements of the statute.</p>
