                        DoD published a proposed rule in the 
                        <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                         at <a href="/citation/86-FR-27354" class="fr-reference" data-reference="86 FR 27354">86 FR 27354</a> on May 20, 2021, to implement section 818 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/115/public/91" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 115-91</a>). Section 818 amends <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2305" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2305</a> to enhance postaward debriefing rights for competitive negotiated contracts, task orders, and delivery orders that exceed $10 million and to provide offerors the opportunity, upon receiving a postaward debriefing, to submit follow-up questions related to the debriefing and to receive agency responses. Section 818 also amends <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/31/3553" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">31 U.S.C. 3553(d)(4)</a> to delay the beginning of the timeframe during which the contracting officer shall immediately suspend contract performance or terminate the awarded contract if a protest is filed. These changes may also impact the timeframe for filing a timely protest. Four respondents submitted public comments in response to the proposed rule.
                    </p>
                    <h2 id="h-8">II. Discussion and Analysis</h2>
                    <p id="p-7" data-page="15808">DoD reviewed the public comments in the development of the final rule. A discussion of the comments and the changes made to the rule as a result of those comments is provided, as follows:</p>

                    <p id="p-8" data-page="15808">Edits were made to the proposed rule to clarify the time periods for requesting, delivering, and completing the postaward debriefing, including the impact of additional questions on the timely submission of protests to the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Conforming edits were made to the time periods associated with protests to the GAO and in the solicitation provision and contract clause.</p>

                    <h4 id="h-11">1. Support for the Rule</h4>
                    <p id="p-9" data-page="15808">
                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         Some respondents supported the rule.

                        <em>Response:</em>

                    <p id="p-11" data-page="15808">
                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         Some respondents requested that DoD clarify the timelines for additional questions as it pertains to the protest window.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-12" data-page="15808">
                        <em>Response:</em>
                         DoD has simplified the text throughout the final rule to address potential confusion and adopt the plain language interpretation in 
                        <em>Nika Technologies Inc.</em>
                         v. 
                        <em>United States</em>, United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, decided February 4, 2021. The final rule is revised to clarify that, for DoD, the 5-day protest window at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 33.104 begins on the date that the postaward debriefing is offered, unless additional questions are received within 2 business days after the debriefing date. If the agency receives timely additional questions from the offeror, the agency will respond in writing within 5 business days. Upon delivery of the agency response, the 5-day protest window will begin.
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="h-13">3. Expansion to Successful Offerors</h4>
                    <p id="p-13" data-page="15808">
                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent expressed concerns that the proposed rule expands the requirement to provide a postaward debriefing to successful offerors, although section 818 only requires a debriefing of disappointed offerors.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-14" data-page="15808">
                        <em>Response:</em>
                         The proposed rule does not expand the requirement for postaward debriefings to successful offerors, because the FAR already provides for postaward debriefings to both successful and unsuccessful offerors at FAR 15.506(b).
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="h-14">4. Untimely Additional Questions</h4>
                    <p id="p-15" data-page="15808">
                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent recommended that additional questions be permitted more than 2 days after the debriefing and answered voluntarily without impacting the process.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-16" data-page="15808">
                        <em>Response:</em>
                         While contracting officers have the discretion to voluntarily answer questions received after the postaward debriefing is concluded, the statute requires a response to only those questions received within 2 business days after the postaward debriefing.
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="h-15">5. Source Selection Decision Document Release</h4>
                    <p id="p-17" data-page="15808">
                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent recommended DoD provide the source selection decision document prior to the postaward debriefing, because it may result in more relevant questions and fewer requests for debriefings.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-18" data-page="15808">
                        <em>Response:</em>
                         The statute provides that certain offerors requesting a debriefing in accordance with FAR 15.506 are eligible to receive a redacted source selection decision document as part of the postaward debriefing. As a result of section 818, debriefed offerors will have the opportunity to submit additional follow-up questions about the debriefing, including questions about the source selection decision document.
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="h-16">6. Document Redaction Standards</h4>
                    <p id="p-19" data-page="15808">
                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent expressed concerns that the quality of redactions is inconsistent and suggested that strict standards be set for redacting source selection documentation to protect proprietary information before implementing this policy change.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-20" data-page="15808">
                        <em>Response:</em>
                         Establishing additional redaction guidelines beyond those already in the FAR is outside scope of this rule.

DoD is applying the rule to contracts for the acquisition of commercial products including COTS items and for the acquisition of commercial services.

                    <h3 id="h-19">A. Applicability to Contracts at or Below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT)</h3>
                    <p id="p-26" data-page="15809"><a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1905" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C 1905</a> governs the applicability of laws to contracts or subcontracts in amounts not greater than the SAT. It is intended to limit the applicability of laws to such contracts or subcontracts. <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1905" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1905</a> provides that if a provision of law contains criminal or civil penalties, or if the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (FAR Council) makes a determination that it is not in the best interest of the Federal Government to exempt contracts or subcontracts at or below the SAT, the law will apply to them. The Principal Director, Defense Pricing and Contracting (DPC), is the appropriate authority to make comparable determinations for regulations to be published in the DFARS, which is part of the FAR system of regulations. DoD did not make that determination. Therefore, this rule does not apply below the SAT.</p>
                    <h3 id="h-20">B. Applicability to Contracts for the Acquisition of Commercial Products Including Commercially Available Off-the-Shelf (COTS) Items and for the Acquisition of Commercial Services</h3>

Due to delegations of authority from USD(A&amp;S), the Principal Director, DPC is the appropriate authority to make this determination. DoD has made that determination. Therefore, this rule does apply to the acquisition of commercial products including COTS items and to the acquisition of commercial services, if otherwise applicable.</p>
                    <h3 id="h-21">C. Determination</h3>
                    <p id="p-28" data-page="15809">Given that the requirements of section 818 apply to contracts valued at $10 million or higher, DoD will not apply the requirements of section 818 to contracts valued at or below the SAT. However, DoD will apply the requirements of section 818 to negotiated procurements and contracts for the acquisition of commercial products including COTS items and for the acquisition of commercial services.</p>
                    <p id="p-29" data-page="15809">It is not in the best interest of the Federal Government to exempt application of this rule to commercial products including COTS items and to commercial services, for the following reasons. Implementation of section 818 affords offerors the opportunity for enhanced postaward debriefings for contracts, task orders, and delivery orders that exceed $10 million. Implementation provides offerors the opportunity, upon receiving a postaward debriefing, to submit follow-up questions related to the debriefing and to receive an agency response. These enhanced postaward debriefing requirements will assist in developing small business capabilities, provide increased participation, and promote competition. Properly conducted postaward debriefings with this enhanced transparency may minimize the number of unnecessary protests filed while strengthening relationships between DoD and industry.</p>
                    <p id="p-30" data-page="15809">Applying these requirements to the acquisition of commercial products and commercial services does not increase the burden on offerors, since the rule only enhances existing requirements concerning postaward debriefings. Exclusion of acquisitions of commercial products including COTS items and of commercial services would greatly limit access to the benefits afforded to successful and unsuccessful offerors by the section 818 requirements.</p>
                    <h2 id="h-22">IV. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563</h2>
                    <p id="p-31" data-page="15809">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility.

L. 115-91</a>), which provides offerors and contractors with significantly enhanced written or oral debriefing information for negotiated contracts and task orders or delivery orders that exceed $100 million, and the opportunity for small entities and nontraditional defense contractors to obtain such information for awards that exceed $10 million but do not exceed $100 million.</p>
                    <p id="p-35" data-page="15809">The objective of the rule is to ensure offerors are provided a standard written or oral postaward debriefing at the dollar thresholds in the statute, while protecting the confidential and proprietary information of other offerors. The statute also provides direction to contracting officers when notified that a protest has been received by the Government Accountability Office.</p>

                        This rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, because the enhanced ability to obtain source selection information for actions over $10 million by submitting questions is voluntary. However,

Of those actions, an average of 3,994 were awarded to approximately 1,543 unique small entities and 1,311 nontraditional defense contractors. Based upon that data, approximately 1,543 unique small entities will have the opportunity to request and obtain enhanced debriefing information if desired.</p>
