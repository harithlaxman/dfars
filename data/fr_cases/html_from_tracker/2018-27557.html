                <p id="p-6" data-page="65560">
                    DoD published a proposed rule in the 
                    <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                     at <a href="/citation/83-FR-42828" class="fr-reference" data-reference="83 FR 42828">83 FR 42828</a> on August 24, 2018, to implement sections 817 and 881(b) of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2017.
                </p>
                <p id="p-7" data-page="65560">Section 817 extends the domestic source requirements of <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2533a" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2533a</a> (the Berry Amendment) below the simplified acquisition threshold, when acquiring athletic footwear to be furnished to the members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps upon their initial entry into the Armed Forces.</p>
                <p id="p-8" data-page="65560">Section 881(b) amends <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2500" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2500(1)</a> by adding Australia and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the United States and Canada as the countries within which the activities of the national technology and industrial base are conducted. <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2534" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2534</a>, Miscellaneous Limitations on the Procurement of Goods Other Than United States Goods, requires that DoD only procure certain items if the manufacturer of the items is part of the national technology and industrial base.</p>
                <p id="p-9" data-page="65560">One respondent submitted a public comment in response to the proposed rule.</p>
                <h2 id="h-8">II. Discussion and Analysis</h2>
                <p id="p-10" data-page="65560">The public comment received addressed concern with regard to importation of radioactive steel and use of radioactively contaminated scrap metal. This issue is outside the scope of this rule. There were no changes from the proposed rule as a result of this public comment.</p>
                <p id="p-11" data-page="65560">
                    However, the final rule is affected by a change in the baseline. On May 30, 2018, DoD published a final rule in the 
                    <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                     (<a href="/citation/83-FR-24890" class="fr-reference" data-reference="83 FR 24890">83 FR 24890</a>) to amend the DFARS to implement section 813(a) of the NDAA for FY 2018 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/115/public/91" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 115-91</a>), which amended <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2534" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2534(c)</a> to establish a sunset date of October 1, 2018, for the limitation on procurement of chemical weapons antidote contained in automatic injectors (and components for such injectors). The final rule deleted DFARS 225.7005 in its entirety to remove the limitation as implemented in the DFARS. As a result, this final rule does not include the changes proposed to DFARS 225.7005-1.

This clause is already prescribed for use in solicitations and contracts using FAR part 12 procedures for the acquisition of commercial items, including commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) items.<span class="printed-page-inline unprinted-element document-markup" data-page="65561">

Because <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2534" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2534</a> predated FASA, it was not subject to <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1905" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1905-1907</a>. The DFARS clause 252.225-7029 was included on the initial list of statutes applicable to the acquisition of commercial items at DFARS 252.212-7001, incorporated in the DFARS by DFARS Case 95-D712 on November 30, 1995 (Defense Acquisition Circular 91-9).</p>

                    With regard to implementation of section 817, this rule may apply to only a few small entities, because there are few sources that meet the domestic source requirements of the Berry Amendment with regard to athletic footwear. The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) estimates a potential annual demand for approximately 200,000 to 250,000 pairs of athletic shoes to be delivered at the rate of approximately 27,500 pairs per month. In response to a request for information issued by DLA in December 2016, there were 5 responses from athletic footwear manufacturers, one of which was a small business. Small entities who are athletic shoe manufacturers could likely support portions of the Department's total requirements for athletic footwear. In addition, there are likely a number of domestic component suppliers who are small entities who would benefit from this new requirement as well. On the other hand, small entities that cannot provide athletic shoes that meet the domestic source requirements of the Berry Amendment, will no longer be able to compete for acquisition of athletic footwear at or below the simplified acquisition threshold that are for the purpose of providing athletic

                <p id="p-27" data-page="65562">With regard to implementation of section 881(b), this rule will not apply to any small entities at the prime contract level, as there are only a few prime contractors for the restricted items, which are all U.S. firms that are other than small businesses. For the definition of &ldquo;small business,&rdquo; the Regulatory Flexibility Act refers to the Small Business Act, which in turn allows the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) Administrator to specify detailed definitions or standards (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601(3)</a> and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/15/632" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15 U.S.C. 632(a)</a>).

Therefore, if an item currently purchased from a U.S. entity that is other than a small business were to be purchased from an entity in the Australia or the United Kingdom, there could be an impact on a few small entities that are currently subcontractors to a U.S. prime contractor.</p>
