Section 880 specifies the criteria that must be met in order to include lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) source selection criteria in a solicitation; and requires solicitations predominantly for the acquisition of certain services and supplies to avoid the use of LPTA source selection criteria, to the maximum extent practicable. Nine respondents submitted public comments in response to the proposed rule.</p>

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         Respondents expressed concern that the rule will be considered a complete ban on the use of the LPTA source selection process. A respondent is specifically concerned that the use of the LPTA source selection process is prohibited for a significant number of information technology (IT) supplies and services that can be appropriately purchased using the process. As a result, the respondent recommends that the rule not be implemented, or be revised to narrow the scope of IT products and services to which the rule applies, because the rule, as proposed, will result in increased acquisition lead times and higher prices without a corresponding increase in quality of services.

                         It is not the intent of the rule to prohibit the use of the LPTA source selection process. Instead, the intent of the rule is to implement the statutory language, which aims to identify circumstances that must exist for an acquisition to use the LPTA source selection process and certain types of requirements that will regularly benefit from the use of tradeoff source selection procedures. Specifically, section 880 requires use of the LPTA

With the exception of telecommunications devices, the rule does not preclude buying IT supplies on an LPTA basis.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         Respondents recommended that sections 813, 822, and 880, to the maximum extent practicable, be harmonized in the FAR and the DoD-unique requirements be addressed in the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS). Another respondent recommended revising the proposed FAR rule text to add cross-references to the DFARS, when DoD-unique requirements exist, in order to avoid confusion for individuals that are unaware of the DFARS requirements.

                         The intent of this rule is to implement section 880 of the NDAA for FY 2019 in the FAR. Sections 813 of the NDAA for FY 2017 and 822 of the NDAA for FY 2018, which prescribe limitations on the use of the LPTA source selection process for DoD, are implemented in the DFARS. These statutes, as codified, are similar, but not identical, in text. As such, the statutes are implemented separately, and in their entirety, in the FAR and DFARS, respectively, in order to provide contracting officers with a single, complete, clear, and uniform policy on the use of the LPTA source selection process, as it applies to their agency. Contracting officers are responsible for being aware of and complying with acquisition policies and procedures, including the FAR and other applicable agency regulations; therefore, it is not necessary to make cross-references to agency supplements in the FAR.

                         Respondents asserted that section 880(c) applies to DoD because the term &ldquo;executive agencies&rdquo; does not appear in that paragraph of the statute; as such, the DoD should also be excluded from using the LPTA source selection process to acquire health care services and records and telecommunications devices and services, as directed in section 880(c). Respondents advised that because section 813, as amended by section 822, existed at the time section 880 was written, it is the intent of section 880 to clarify and/or add to the limitations of section 813, which apply only to DoD.

                         The Councils agree that it is important to clearly identify and communicate the functional, performance, and physical requirements of a supply or service being acquired by an agency. To facilitate this goal, guidance, tools, and training are available to acquisition personnel on a variety of acquisition topics (

                         The Councils agree that it is essential to exercise appropriate and adequate oversight of contractor performance on all contracts. Contracting officers are responsible for ensuring compliance with the terms of the contract, while safeguarding the interests of the United States in its contractual relationships. In addition, agencies are required to establish effective management practices to monitor and evaluate contract performance and compliance, and prevent fraud, waste, and abuse in service contracting.

                         A respondent recommended establishing adequate monitoring systems to ensure LPTA is applied appropriately and only when the requirements of a contract meet the rule's criteria. The respondent also suggested that public accountability should be established, possibly through the System for Award Management (SAM) at SAM.gov contract opportunities notice, when a contracting officer uses the LPTA source selection process.

                         Contracting officers are responsible for ensuring that the requirements of this rule are met when issuing a solicitation that includes the LPTA source selection process. Agencies have internal controls and procedures to monitor and evaluate their compliance with acquisition rules, regulations, and policies. To maintain public accountability, the respondent suggests that agencies publish the LPTA determination in the SAM.gov contract opportunities notice. However, section 880 does not require public notice or publication of the documented determination to use LPTA source selection criteria, and the Councils do not believe additional oversight protocols are required at this time.

                         A respondent advised against using LPTA source selection criteria in solicitations for multiple award IT supply contracts that require contractors to bid on a notional supply list. The respondent advised that this approach leads to unrealistically low-priced offers for the items on the initial supply list, but substantially higher-priced offers for supplies added to the contracts or refreshed after contract award. As a result, the Government does not realize the cost savings that is implied during the initial contract award.

                         Contracting officers are responsible for ensuring that the requirements of this rule are met when issuing a solicitation that includes the LPTA source selection process. Section 880 does not prohibit the use of the LPTA source selection process when issuing multiple-award indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contracts. Section 880 does require contracting officers to avoid, to the maximum extent practicable, using the LPTA source selection process in the case of a procurement that is predominantly for the acquisition of telecommunications devices and services. The rule reflects this statutory requirement.

When issuing or modifying these contracts, contracting officers must evaluate the reasonableness of the offered prices, in accordance with the procedures of FAR part 13 or 15, as applicable. When placing orders under these contracts, FAR subpart 16.5 requires contracting officers to consider price or cost as part of their selection decision for each order. These procedures help to ensure that the contracted price and the price paid under each order is fair and reasonable to the Government.

                        DoD, GSA, and NASA have prepared a Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (FRFA) consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>, 
                        <em>et seq.</em>
                         The FRFA is summarized as follows:
                    </p>
                    
                        <p id="p-36" data-page="3681">This rule is necessary to implement section 880 of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/115/public/232" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 115-232</a>). The objective of this rule is to avoid the use of lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) source selection criteria in circumstances that would deny the Government the benefits of cost and technical tradeoffs in the source selection process. No public comments were received in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis.</p>
                        <p id="p-37" data-page="3681">
                            DoD, GSA, and NASA do not expect this rule to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>, 
                            <em>et seq.</em>
                             The rule primarily affects internal Government requirements determination decisions, acquisition strategy decisions, and contract file documentation requirements. The Government does not collect data on the total number of solicitations issued on an annual basis that do or do not specify the use of the LPTA source selection process. However, the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) provides the following information for FY 2018:
                        </p>

          <li id="p-38" data-page="3681">Federal competitive contracts and orders awarded using FAR parts 13, 15, or subpart 16.5 procedures. In FY 2018, the Federal Government, excluding DoD, awarded approximately 82,337 new contracts and orders using the competitive procedures of FAR parts 13, 15, or subpart 16.5. This data excludes acquisitions for the supply/service categories identified in section 880(c) of the NDAA for FY 2019. Of the 82,337 contracts and orders, approximately 69 percent (or 56,622 contracts and orders) were awarded to approximately 27,029 unique small businesses. It is important to note that FPDS does not collect data on solicitations. FPDS can identify contracts that are awarded using competitive procedures, but did not begin collecting data on the source selection process used to award those contracts until 2020. Therefore, the data described above represents all competitively awarded contracts, including those using other than the LPTA source selection process.</li>
