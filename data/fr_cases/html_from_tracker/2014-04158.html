                <p id="p-6" data-page="11336">This final rule finalizes an interim rule that revised the DFARS to implement section 827 (except paragraph (g)) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/112/public/239" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 112-239</a>, enacted January 2, 2013). Section 827, entitled &ldquo;Enhancement of Whistleblower Protections for Contractor Employees,&rdquo; made extensive changes to <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2409" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2409</a>, entitled &ldquo;Contractor employees: Protection from reprisal or disclosure.&rdquo; Paragraph (g) of section 827, which amended <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2324" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paragraph (k) of 10 U.S.C. 2324</a>, entitled &ldquo;Allowable costs under defense contracts,&rdquo; is addressed under a separate DFARS case, 2013-D022, Allowability of Legal Costs for Whistleblower Proceedings.</p>
                <p id="p-7" data-page="11336">Section 827 of the NDAA for FY 2013 created a standalone statute for DoD that is independent of the FAR coverage.</p>
                <p id="p-8" data-page="11336">
                    DoD published an interim rule in the 
                    <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                     at <a href="/citation/78-FR-59851" class="fr-reference" data-reference="78 FR 59851">78 FR 59851</a> on September 30, 2013, to implement statutory amendments to the whistleblower protections for contractor and subcontractor employees. One respondent submitted a public comment in response to the interim rule.

                <h2 id="h-8">II. Discussion and Analysis</h2>
                <h3 id="h-9">A. Public Comments</h3>
                <p id="p-9" data-page="11336">DoD reviewed the public comment in the development of the final rule. A discussion of the comment is provided below.</p>
                <p id="p-10" data-page="11336">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     The respondent recommended reinstating the clarifying statements at DFARS 203.903 and 203.905 that &ldquo;The following policy applies to DoD instead of the policy at FAR 3.903/3.905.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p id="p-11" data-page="11336">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     In the final rule, DoD has inserted a statement in section 203.900, Scope, to indicate that DFARS subpart 203.9 is to be used in lieu of FAR subpart 3.9. DFARS contractor whistleblower policies are based on <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2409" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2409</a>, which is no longer implemented in the FAR (see FAR 3.900).
                </p>
                <h3 id="h-10">B. Other Changes</h3>
                <p id="p-12" data-page="11336">DoD has incorporated other non-substantive editorial changes in the final rule. In addition to redesignation of some paragraphs to conform to DFARS numbering conventions and minor wording changes for clarity, DoD has relocated DFARS 203.907, Classified information, to DFARS 203.903(2), because section 3.907 in the FAR is titled &ldquo;Whistleblower Protections Under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the Recovery Act).&rdquo; DoD cannot assign a new title to the corresponding section in the DFARS.</p>
                <h2 id="h-11">II. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563</h2>
                <p id="p-13" data-page="11336">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993.

                <p id="p-15" data-page="11336">
                    The Department of Defense (DoD) is amending the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations Supplement (DFARS) to implement changes to existing protections for contractor whistleblower employees in accordance with section 827 of the National Defense

                    Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013. Section 827 amends <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2409" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2409</a> and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2324" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2324(k)</a>, making the changes applicable to DoD and NASA. Each agency is amending its FAR supplement. This analysis pertains only to the DFARS final rule. DFARS is revising subpart 203.9, &ldquo;Whistleblower Protections for Contractor Employees.&rdquo; The subpart covers the policy, procedures for filing and investigating complaints, remedies, and the prescription for the clause at DFARS 252.203-7002, entitled &ldquo;Requirement to Inform Employees of Whistleblower Rights.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p id="p-16" data-page="11337">The rule applies to all entities, small as well as large, at the prime contract and subcontract level. However, not all entities will have a situation that requires an employee to use the whistleblower provisions, and there is no way to predict the potential number of whistleblowers in advance. However, a small entity could be impacted by a whistleblower employee either as a Government prime contractor or subcontractor. In addition, the impact on an entity is directly related to the seriousness of the alleged wrongdoing.</p>
                <p id="p-17" data-page="11337">No comments were received from the public on the Regulatory Flexibility analysis. No comments were received from the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration.</p>
                <p id="p-18" data-page="11337">There are no reporting requirements associated with this rule. However, a firm accused of retaliating against an employee whistleblower is likely to be required to furnish human resources documentation to disprove the accusation. This documentation, however, would only be required in the course of an investigation of the accusation, not as a result of a contract clause.</p>
                <p id="p-19" data-page="11337">There are no alternatives to this rule. Because of the terms used in the statute, DoD is unable to exempt small entities or establish a dollar threshold for coverage. Regardless of the size of the business, a whistleblower employee must be protected from retaliation by his/her employer.</p>
