                <p id="p-6" data-page="10989">
                    DoD published a proposed rule in the 
                    <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                     at <a href="/citation/84-FR-50811" class="fr-reference" data-reference="84 FR 50811">84 FR 50811</a> on September 26, 2019, to amend DFARS 206.001 to implement section 815 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/114/public/92" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 114-92</a>). Section 815 repeals and replaces section 845 of the NDAA for FY 1994 (Pub. L. 103-160; <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2371" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2371 note</a>) with <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2371b" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2371b</a>, which modifies the authority of DoD to carry out other transaction (OT) agreements for prototype projects, as well as the criteria required to award an associated follow-on production contract to the participants in the other transaction agreement without the use of competitive procedures. One respondent submitted comments on the proposed rule.
                </p>
                <h2 id="h-8">II. Discussion and Analysis</h2>
                <h3 id="h-9">A. Summary of Significant Changes</h3>
                <p id="p-7" data-page="10989">The purpose of this rule is to provide contracting officers with updated internal guidance when awarding a follow-on production contract that is exempt from the competitive procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation part 6, as set forth in <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2371b" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2371b</a>. The rule is not intended to implement policy, regulation, or guidance on DoD's authority to enter into OT prototype agreements at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2371b" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2371b</a>. As such, this final rule changes the rule text to specify that the agreements officer for the OT agreement for the prototype project is responsible for providing to the contracting officer information that confirms the requirements to award a noncompetitive follow-on production contract, as specified in <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2371b" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2371b</a> and DoD OT agreement policy, have been met.</p>
                <h3 id="h-10">B. Analysis of Public Comments</h3>
                <p id="p-8" data-page="10989">DoD reviewed the public comments in the development of the final rule. A discussion of the comments and the changes made to the rule as a result of those comments is provided, as follows:</p>
                <p id="p-9" data-page="10989">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     The respondent advised that DoD should provide clear guidance on what constitutes &ldquo;successful completion&rdquo; of a prototype transaction; the rule text should be clarified to explain what it means to award a follow-on production contract to &ldquo;the participants in the transaction,&rdquo; as contracts are usually made between the Government and a single entity; the rule should clarify what a &ldquo;participant&rdquo; is, given that not all parties to a transaction necessarily participate in the project.
                </p>
                <p id="p-10" data-page="10989">The respondent also advised that the rule should be revised to clarify the prerequisites for awarding the OT for the prototype project and the prerequisites for awarding a follow-on production contract. Specifically, one of the criteria for awarding a follow-on production contract is that the OT for the prototype project is based on specific determinations made by certain acquisition officials according to different threshold values. The proposed rule, however, applies these determination requirements only to the follow-on production contract, when they should instead apply only to the initial OT agreement.</p>
                <p id="p-11" data-page="10989">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     This rule is not intended to implement policy, regulation, or guidance on DoD's authority to enter into OT prototype agreements at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2371b" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2371b</a>. Instead, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (OUSD(A&amp;S)) is the organization responsible for promulgation of policy for OT agreements, which can be viewed at 
                    <em><a href="https://aaf.dau.edu/aaf/ot-guide/" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://aaf.dau.edu/&#8203;aaf/&#8203;ot-guide/&#8203;</a>.</em>
                     As a result, this rule is modified to clarify that the contracting officer does not make the determination that the prototype project was successfully completed and, instead, should receive that information from the agreements officer for the OT agreement.

                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     The respondent advised that <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-32/part-3" class="cfr external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">32 CFR part 3</a> should be updated to reflect the current authority at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2371b" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2371b</a>.

                <p id="p-16" data-page="10990">E.O.s 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993.</p>

A major rule under the Congressional Review Act cannot take effect until 60 days after it is published in the 
                    <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                    . The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has determined that this rule is not a major rule as defined by <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/804" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 804</a>.

                     The FRFA is summarized as follows:
                </p>
                <p id="p-19" data-page="10990">The Department of Defense is amending the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) to implement section 815 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/114/public/92" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 114-92</a>), which repeals and replaces section 845 of the NDAA for FY 1994 (Pub.

                <p id="p-20" data-page="10990">The objective of this rule is to provide contracting officers with updated internal guidance when awarding a follow-on production contract that is exempt from the competitive procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation part 6, as set forth in <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2371b" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2371b</a>.</p>
                <p id="p-21" data-page="10990">No public comments were received in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis.</p>
                <p id="p-22" data-page="10990">DoD does not collect data on the number of follow-on production contracts that are awarded annually and associated with a prototype project transaction agreement made under the authority of <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2371b" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2371b</a>; therefore, DoD is unable to estimate the number of small entities that will be impacted by this rule. However, DoD does not expect small entities to be significantly impacted by this rule, because the rule does not change any existing processes or impose any additional burdens. Instead, the rule simply clarifies instructions to contracting officers on the criteria that must be met in order to award an associated follow-on production contract without using competitive procedures.</p>
                <p id="p-23" data-page="10990">This rule does not include any new reporting, recordkeeping, or other compliance requirements for small entities.
