                    <h2 id="h-7">I. Background</h2>
                    <p id="p-6" data-page="38311">This is a final rule to amend FAR subparts 13.5 and 18.2 to implement section 815 of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2015 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/113/public/291" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 113-291</a>). Section 815 amends section 4202(e) of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 (Divisions D and E of <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/104/public/106" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 104-106</a>; <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2304" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2304 note</a>) to make permanent the test program for special simplified procedures for purchases of commercial items greater than the simplified acquisition threshold, but not exceeding $6.5 million ($12 million for certain acquisitions). Conforming changes are made in parts 12, 13, and 18.</p>
                    <h2 id="h-8">II. Publication of This Final Rule for Public Comment Is Not Required by Statute</h2>
                    <p id="p-7" data-page="38311">&ldquo;Publication of proposed regulations&rdquo;, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1707" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1707</a>, is the statute which applies to the publication of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Paragraph (a)(1) of the statute requires that a procurement policy, regulation, procedure, or form (including an amendment or modification thereof) must be published for public comment if it relates to the expenditure of appropriated funds, and has either a significant effect beyond the internal operating procedures of the agency issuing the policy, regulation, procedure, or form, or has a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors. This final rule is not required to be published for public comment because it makes permanent a statutory authority that currently exists within the FAR.</p>
                    <h2 id="h-9">III. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563</h2>
                    <p id="p-8" data-page="38311">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under Section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993. This rule is not a major rule under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/804" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 804</a>.</p>
                    <h2 id="h-10">IV. Regulatory Flexibility Act</h2>
                    <p id="p-9" data-page="38311">The Regulatory Flexibility Act does not apply to this rule because this final rule does not constitute a significant FAR revision within the meaning of FAR 1.501-1 and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1707" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1707</a> does not require publication for public comment.</p>
                    <h2 id="h-11">V. Paperwork Reduction Act</h2>
                    <p id="p-10" data-page="38311">The rule does not contain any information collection requirements that require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/44/3501" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44 U.S.C. chapter 35</a>).</p>
