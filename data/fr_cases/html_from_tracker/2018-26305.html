                    <strong>Federal Register</strong>

L. 115-91</a>). Section 813(b) repeals section 858 of the NDAA for FY 2015 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/113/public/291" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub.

A determination was signed by the Director, Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy, on October 13, 2011, to not apply the requirements of section 846 of the NDAA for FY 2011 to contracts at or below the simplified acquisition threshold, but to apply the rule to contracts for the acquisition of commercial items, including commercially available off-the-shelf items.</p>

                <p id="p-11" data-page="62499">
                    A final regulatory flexibility analysis (FRFA) has been prepared consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>, 
                    <em>et seq.</em>
                     The FRFA is summarized as follows:
                </p>
                <p id="p-12" data-page="62499">This rule implements section 813(b) of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/115/public/91" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 115-91</a>), which repealed of section 858 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY 2015 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/113/public/291" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 113-291</a>), while retaining the requirements of section 846 of the NDAA for FY 2011 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/111/public/383" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 111-383</a>), with regard to sources of photovoltaic devices purchased by contractors that become the property of DoD.</p>
                <p id="p-13" data-page="62499">The objective of this rule is to revert to the regulations on photovoltaic devices that were in effect prior to superimposing the additional regulations required by section 858 on November 20, 2015 (<a href="/citation/80-FR-72599" class="fr-reference" data-reference="80 FR 72599">80 FR 72599</a>). By restoring the tie to the Buy American statute, this rule reinstates the Buy American exceptions for acquisitions of photovoltaic devices below the micro-purchase threshold, nonavailability, unreasonable cost, and public interest, including the DoD class determinations that exempt U.S.-made and qualifying country photovoltaic devices from the requirements of the Buy American statute, as well as the Governmentwide determination that removes the component test for commercially available off-the-shelf items.</p>
                <p id="p-14" data-page="62499">No significant issues were raised by the public comments in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis. No public comments were received.  </p>
                <p id="p-15" data-page="62499">This rule generally applies at the prime contract level to other than small entities. When purchasing renewable power generated via onsite photovoltaic devices, DoD can either purchase the photovoltaic devices and thereby own, operate, and maintain the devices for their full economic life (already covered in DFARS part 225 under standard Buy American statute/Trade Agreements regulations) or, for example, may do some variation of the following:</p>
                <p id="p-16" data-page="62499">a. Enter into an energy savings performance contract, which is a contracting method in which the contractor provides capital to facilitate energy conservation measures and maintains them in exchange for a portion of the energy savings generated. Under this arrangement, the Government would take title to the devices during contract performance or at the conclusion of the contract. For example, DoD uses either the master indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity contract of the Department of Energy or the Army Corps of Engineers and awards task orders off one of those contracts. Generally, the same approved contractors are on each contract. Of the approved contractors, all but one are large businesses. There are subcontracting goals that each contractor has to meet, but the ultimate task order award is most often made to a large business.</p>
                <p id="p-17" data-page="62499">b. Enter into a power purchase agreement, also referred to as a utility service contract, for the purchase of the power output of photovoltaic devices that are installed on DoD land or buildings, but owned, operated, and maintained by the contractor. At the conclusion of the contract, DoD would either require the contractor to dismantle and remove the photovoltaic equipment or abandon the equipment in place. Prime contractors for this type of contract would generally be large businesses, based on the capital costs involved in these projects. However, many developers tend to subcontract out the majority of the work to smaller companies.</p>
                <p id="p-18" data-page="62499">There are approximately 80 manufacturers of photovoltaic devices. We do not currently have data available on whether any of the manufacturers of photovoltaic devices are small entities, because the Federal Procurement Data System does not collect such data on subcontractors.</p>
                <p id="p-19" data-page="62499">
                    There are no new reporting burdens under this rule. In fact, there is a 
                    <em>de minimis</em>
                     reduction in burden, because no certification will be required if the value of the photovoltaic devices does not exceed the micro-purchase threshold, and identification of country of origin will no longer be required if the photovoltaic devices are domestic or U.S.-made. Furthermore, since the prime contractors subject to this rule are other than small businesses, the existing reporting requirements do not impact small entities.
                </p>
                <p id="p-20" data-page="62499">DoD did not identify any significant alternatives that meet the requirements of the statute and would have less impact on small entities. The overall effect of this rule is deregulatory and it does not have significant impact on small entities.</p>
                <h2 id="h-12">VI. Paperwork Reduction Act</h2>
                <p id="p-21" data-page="62499">The rule contains information collection requirements that require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/44/3501" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44 U.S.C chapter 35</a>); however, these changes to the DFARS do not impose additional information collection requirements to the paperwork burden previously approved under OMB Control Number 0704-0229, entitled &ldquo;Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) Part 225, Foreign Acquisition, and related clauses at DFARS 252.225.&rdquo;</p>
