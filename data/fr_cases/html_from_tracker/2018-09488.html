                <h1 id="h-6">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</h1>
                <h2 id="h-7">I. Background</h2>
                <p id="p-6" data-page="19641">DoD is amending the DFARS to implement section 801 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/115/public/404" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 115-404</a>). Section 801 directs the insertion of a statement of purpose for Department of Defense acquisition in the DFARS. This rule adds the statement of purpose to DFARS 201.101.</p>
                <h2 id="h-8">II. Applicability to Contracts at or Below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold and for Commercial Items, Including Commercially Available Off-the-Shelf Items</h2>
                <p id="p-7" data-page="19641">This rule does not add any new provisions or clauses or impact existing provisions or clauses. The rule merely adds a purpose statement to the regulations.</p>
                <h2 id="h-9">III. Publication of This Final Rule for Public Comment Is Not Required by Statute</h2>
                <p id="p-8" data-page="19641">The statute that applies to the publication of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) is the Office of Federal Procurement Policy statute (codified at title 41 of the United States Code). Specifically, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1707" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1707(a)(1)</a> requires that a procurement policy, regulation, procedure or form (including an amendment or modification thereof) must be published for public comment if it relates to the expenditure of appropriated funds, and has either a significant effect beyond the internal operating procedures of the agency issuing the policy, regulation, procedure or form, or has a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors. This final rule is not required to be published for public comment, because it clarifies the purpose of the defense system as required by the NDAA for FY 2018. There is no cost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors. These requirements affect only the internal operating guidance of the Government.</p>
                <h2 id="h-10">IV. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563</h2>
                <p id="p-9" data-page="19641">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993. This rule is not a major rule under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/804" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 804</a>.</p>
                <h2 id="h-11">V. <a href="/executive-order/13771" class="eo">Executive Order 13771</a>
</h2>
                <p id="p-10" data-page="19641">This rule is not subject to Executive Order (E.O.) 13771, Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs, because the rule relates to agency organization, management, or personnel.</p>
                <h2 id="h-12">VI. Regulatory Flexibility Act</h2>
                <p id="p-11" data-page="19641">
                    Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment are not required to be given for this rule under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1707" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1707(a)(1)</a> (see section III. of this preamble), the analytical requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a> 
                    <em>et seq.</em>) are not applicable. Accordingly, no regulatory flexibility analysis is required and none has been prepared.
                </p>
                <h2 id="h-13">VII. Paperwork Reduction Act</h2>
                <p id="p-12" data-page="19641">The rule does not contain any information collection requirements that require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/44/3501" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44 U.S.C. chapter 35</a>).</p>
