                         The purpose of this rule is to implement SBA's final rule issued on July 25, 2016, at <a href="/citation/81-FR-48558" class="fr-reference" data-reference="81 FR 48558">81 FR 48558</a>, which established the requirement that certain small business parties to a joint venture perform 40 percent of all work done by the joint venture and that work performed is more than merely performing administrative functions.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         Two respondents expressed concern regarding the potential negative impacts of the rule. One respondent believes that the new rule will undermine small businesses. Under the proposed rule, a large business affiliated under a joint venture with a small business can collectively utilize a combined past performance, making the small business a &ldquo;front&rdquo; for the large business. The respondent believes this rule should be retired and not entered into the FAR. Another respondent stated that the rule places the joint venture in an unfair advantage over other small businesses when considering past performance as an evaluation factor for source selection. The respondent further stated that the joint venture should receive a neutral rating if it has no past performance.

                         This rule is expected to have an overall positive impact on small businesses by creating new opportunities under the mentor-prot&eacute;g&eacute; program. All mentors and prot&eacute;g&eacute;s are subject to the requirements and limitations of the mentor-prot&eacute;g&eacute; program and, in accordance with <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-13/section-121.103#p-121.103(h)(1)(ii)" class="cfr external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">13 CFR 121.103(h)(1)(ii)</a>, only mentor-prot&eacute;g&eacute; joint ventures are eligible for set-aside opportunities, including those where a large business is a mentor. This final rule requires the small business prot&eacute;g&eacute; or 8(a) participant to perform at least 40 percent of the work done by the joint venture in accordance with <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-13/section-125.8" class="cfr external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">13 CFR 125.8</a>. This rule recognizes that joint ventures perform work through their members, not as independent entities. Furthermore, this rule requires contracting officers to consider the past performance of each party to the joint venture if the joint venture does not demonstrate past performance.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent requested that this case address solicitation language indicating that the managing member must provide relevant past performance information. The respondent believes requesting past performance from a joint venture managing partner does not allow prot&eacute;g&eacute;s to gain experience using their mentor's past performance.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent stated that the amended definition of small business concern does not directly specify whether the contracting officer or SBA is authorized to make the size status determination of a concern. The respondent provided the following suggested language to provide clarity, &ldquo;Contractors shall self-certify size status. Questions of a contractor's size status shall be determined by the Small Business Administration.&rdquo;

                         FAR subpart 19.3, Determination of Small Business Size and Status for Small Business Programs, specifies that SBA makes a size status determination. Therefore, it is not necessary to modify the definition of small business concern.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent requested clarification of the applicability of joint ventures to the GSA FSS Program. The respondent believes that the limited duration of a joint venture creates a conflict for its use in the FSS program. According to the respondent, under the FSS program contracts may be awarded for up to 20 years, in 5-year increments, and joint ventures are set up to bid on a specific job and may last up to six years, including one extension.

                        <em>Response:</em>
                         This rule implements SBA's final rule at <a href="/citation/85-FR-66146" class="fr-reference" data-reference="85 FR 66146">85 FR 66146</a>, published on October 16, 2020, which provides further clarification regarding the requirements for joint venture formation and duration.

                         notice for the proposed rule, the clarification that 8(a) joint venture agreements need only be approved by the SBA prior to contract award is necessary because the Government Accountability Office (GAO) sustained a protest (BGI-Fiore JV, LLC, B-409520, May 29, 2014) in which an agency rejected an 8(a) joint venture's proposal on the basis that the 8(a) joint venture had not been certified by the SBA prior to submission of proposals. As stated in GAO's decision, GAO affirmed the protestor's argument that the agency improperly rejected its proposal. The use of the adjective &ldquo;improper&rdquo; in the

                        rule is derived directly from the text of the GAO decision. Further, the adjective suggested by the respondent, &ldquo;unintended&rdquo;, does not have the same meaning as &ldquo;improper&rdquo; and is not an appropriate substitution in this context. Finally, the suggested revision has no effect on the text of the rule; therefore, the final rule is unchanged.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent was concerned about &ldquo;certification of the joint venture as an 8(a)&rdquo; participant and how to properly address this situation given the workload of the SBA Business Opportunity Specialist. The respondent stated that the two proposals his joint venture proposed required a certification letter, which they did not have due to the joint venture not being approved. The respondent provided that his SBA office and Business Opportunity Specialist will not review any joint ventures unless a contracting officer or agency is willing to make an award, which is well after the proposal process is completed. To address this situation, the respondent recommended that the SBA conduct preliminary reviews prior to the submission of a contract effort and possibly when the joint venture is formed (approve the joint venture agreement and/or certify the joint venture is small) then conduct a full review at contract award. The respondent believes this approach will reduce the risk to the members of the joint venture of having to go through the proposal process only to be disqualified by the SBA.

                         The Councils acknowledge the respondents concern with certification of the joint venture as an 8(a) participant and the differing interpretations of FAR clause 52.219-18, Notification of Competition Limited to Eligible 8(a) Concerns. Some have interpreted this clause to mean that 8(a) joint ventures that submitted an offer for an 8(a) contract needed to be &ldquo;certified&rdquo; by the SBA and the joint venture agreement needed to be approved by the SBA by &ldquo;the time of submission of offer.&rdquo; This interpretation of the FAR clause is incorrect. This final rule amends the FAR to clarify that 8(a) joint ventures are not certified into the 8(a) program, and that 8(a) joint venture agreements need only be approved by the SBA prior to the award of an 8(a) sole source contract to prevent the improper elimination of 8(a) joint venture proposals in the future.

The final rule amends FAR 19.3, Determination of Small Business Status for Small Business Programs, to address how a joint venture may qualify for an award as a small business concern under the socioeconomic programs. A joint venture may qualify as a small business concern if each participant in the joint venture qualifies as small under the size standard for the solicitation, or the prot&eacute;g&eacute; is small under the size standard for the solicitation in a joint venture comprised of a mentor and prot&eacute;g&eacute; with an approved agreement under a SBA mentor prot&eacute;g&eacute; program. A joint venture may qualify under socioeconomic programs when the joint venture qualifies as a small business joint venture and one of the parties to the joint venture qualifies under one or more of the socioeconomic programs. Therefore, an offer submitted by the joint venture made up of a mentor and prot&eacute;g&eacute; will be considered small. The language in the final rule is consistent with SBA's regulations.

Although acquisitions under the SAT are set aside for small businesses by law, some awards are made to other than small businesses because small businesses are not able to meet the performance requirements. Section 1641 advances the interests of small business concerns by allowing for more joint ventures that include a small business to qualify as a small business or under a socioeconomic program. This access allows such small businesses to perform work under SAT set-asides as part of a joint venture that they cannot perform as stand-alone entities. Exclusion of a large segment of Federal contracting, such as acquisitions under the SAT, will limit the full implementation of these objectives.

Additionally, this rule allows a joint venture to qualify for one of the socioeconomic programs if the joint venture qualifies as a small business joint venture and one of the parties to the joint venture meets the associated requirements of the socioeconomic program.

Currently, agencies are not required to review the past performance of each party to a joint venture; therefore, this rule is expected to help joint ventures to have qualifying past performance for award when a joint venture does not have qualifying past performance. This additional requirement is beneficial to joint ventures that are in the initial stages of their agreement and do not have past performance experience.</p>
                    <p id="p-48" data-page="58222">This rule revises the FAR to align 8(a) joint venture requirements with SBA's regulations, which is expected to decrease the number of protests.

                        <p id="p-53" data-page="58223">There were no significant issues raised by the public comments in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis.</p>
                        <p id="p-54" data-page="58223">The final rule may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601-612</a>. This rule will impact small business joint ventures and small business entities in a SBA mentor-prot&eacute;g&eacute; program. Based on joint venture data in the System for Award Management, the estimated number of small business joint ventures is 3,347. Assuming that each joint venture includes 2 small businesses, the number of small entities impacted is 6,694. According to SBA's final rule, there are an estimated 2,000 pairs of mentors and prot&eacute;g&eacute;s that may be impacted. Therefore, the estimated number of total small entities to which the rule applies is 8,694.</p>
                        <p id="p-55" data-page="58223">This final rule does not include any recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small businesses.</p>
                        <p id="p-56" data-page="58223">Joint ventures will be required to represent themselves as small businesses in accordance with the updated representation provisions at FAR 52.212-3 or 52.219-1. Representation is currently required for all small entities doing business with the Government; however, representation is not a new requirement. The number of options for the entities to select from has merely increased to include joint venture options. Therefore, the potential impact is de minimis.</p>
                        <p id="p-57" data-page="58223">The final rule may have a positive economic impact on small entities. The updated SBA regulations allow for more joint ventures that include a small business to qualify as a small business or under a socioeconomic program; and therefore, more small businesses can qualify for set-aside procurements.</p>
                        <p id="p-58" data-page="58223">There are no known significant alternative approaches to the final rule.</p>
