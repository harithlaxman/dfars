                        DoD published a proposed rule in the 
                        <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                         at <a href="/citation/86-FR-59947" class="fr-reference" data-reference="86 FR 59947">86 FR 59947</a> on October 29, 2021, to implement section 1006 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/115/public/232" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 115-232</a>), as amended by section 1011 of the NDAA for FY 2020 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/116/public/92" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 116-92</a>). Section 1006 applies to accounting firms that provide financial statement auditing to DoD in support of the audit under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/31/3521" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">31 U.S.C. 3521</a> or audit remediation services in support of the Financial Improvement and Audit Remediation Plan described in <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/240b" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 240b</a>. Such firms, when responding to a solicitation or awarded a contract for the acquisition of covered services, must disclose to DoD before any contract action (including award, renewals, and amendments) the details of any disciplinary proceedings with respect to the accounting firm or its associated persons before any entity with the authority to enforce compliance with rules or laws applying to audit services offered by the accounting firm. DoD, as a matter of policy to provide a level playing field between firms that provide audit services to support certain DoD audits, is extending this requirement to firms other than accounting firms that provide such services. Section 1011 amended section 1006 to require any disclosures to be treated as confidential to the extent required by the court or agency in which the proceeding occurred and to be treated in a manner consistent with any protections or privileges established by any other provision of Federal Law.

                    <p id="p-8" data-page="65500">There were no public comments submitted in response to the proposed rule. There are no changes made to the final rule.</p>

                    <p id="p-9" data-page="65500">Consistent with the determinations that DoD made with regard to application of the requirements of section 1006 of the NDAA for FY 2019, as amended by section 1011 of the NDAA for FY 2020, DoD is not applying the requirements of section 1006 of the NDAA for FY 2019 to contracts at or below the SAT; however, DoD is applying the rule to contracts for the acquisition of commercial items, excluding COTS items.</p>
                    <h2 id="h-9">III. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563</h2>
                    <p id="p-10" data-page="65500">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993.</p>

A major rule under the Congressional Review Act cannot take effect until 60 days after it is published in the 
                        <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                        . The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has determined that this rule is not a major rule as defined by <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/804" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 804</a>.

                        <em>et seq.</em>
                         The FRFA is summarized as follows:
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-13" data-page="65500">This final rule is necessary to implement section 1006 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2019, as amended by section 1011 of the NDAA for FY 2020, and DoD policy. Section 1006 applies to accounting firms that provide financial statement auditing to DoD in support of the audit under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/31/3521" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">31 U.S.C. 3521</a> or audit remediation services in support of the Financial Improvement and Audit Remediation Plan described in <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/240b" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 240b</a>.

DoD policy extends this requirement to firms other than accounting firms, in order to provide a level playing field in competitive acquisitions.</p>
                    <p id="p-14" data-page="65500">DoD received no public comments in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis in the proposed rule.</p>
                    <p id="p-15" data-page="65500">DoD estimates there are 12 respondents that submit offers and 10 respondents that receive award of a contract covered by this rule. Of the estimated 12 respondents, DoD further estimates that only two of these respondents are small entities.</p>
                    <p id="p-16" data-page="65500">This rule adds a provision and a clause that require reporting details of any disciplinary proceedings with respect to the firm or its associated persons before any contract action on a covered contract in support of certain DoD audits. There are no other reporting or recordkeeping requirements.</p>
                    <p id="p-17" data-page="65500">
                        There are no significant alternatives that would meet the intent of the

                        statutes. The rule could be applied to only accounting firms, but that would not be fair to accounting firms competing against other than accounting firms. Applying the rule to other than accounting firms does not create a significant burden for small entities.
