                        DoD published a proposed rule in the 
                        <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                         at <a href="/citation/87-FR-4546" class="fr-reference" data-reference="87 FR 4546">87 FR 4546</a> on January 28, 2022, to implement section 871 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/115/public/91" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 115-91</a>). Section 871 established new direction at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/4576" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 4576</a> (formerly <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2322a" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2322a</a>), Requirement for consideration of certain matters during acquisition of noncommercial computer software. The statute requires that DoD, as part of any negotiation for such software, consider all noncommercial computer software and related materials necessary to meet the needs of the agency throughout the life cycle of the software. This rule provides direction to DoD both to improve acquisition planning and to identify and negotiate for software deliverables and license rights at a fair and reasonable price before contract award. Eight respondents submitted public comments in response to the proposed rule. DoD also held a public meeting on March 10, 2022.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One of the respondents noted several areas of alignment between DoD and industry in the proposed rule, including: (1) removal of the definition of the term &ldquo;data&rdquo;; (2) consideration of development at private expense; (3) consideration of alternatives to the formal delivery of source code and software design details; and (4) conformance of the DFARS definition of &ldquo;technical data&rdquo; to the statutory definition at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/3013" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 3013</a> (formerly <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2302" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2302</a>).

                    <p id="p-16" data-page="17340">
                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         Several respondents asserted that a plain language interpretation of <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/4576" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 4576</a> demonstrates that Congress intended for the provision to apply to only noncommercial computer software. Based on this interpretation, the respondents asserted that the proposed rule should not apply to commercial software, contrary to DoD's proposed revisions in DFARS 227.7202-1(d). The respondents also asserted that application of the proposed rule to commercial software is detrimental to the availability of commercial software, creates a barrier for nontraditional contractors, and is inconsistent with the commercial software industry's licensing models. Several respondents also asserted that the term &ldquo;all necessary license rights&rdquo; in DFARS 227.7203-2(b)(6)(ii)(A) and (B) may be improperly applied to commercial software or misconstrued to mean a government purpose rights license or an unlimited rights license.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-17" data-page="17340">
                        <em>Response:</em>
                         DoD acknowledges that <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/4576" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 4576</a> includes express references to noncommercial software and therefore must apply to noncommercial software. However, the statute does not prohibit the prescribed consideration of the Government's life-cycle needs from applying to negotiations for commercial software. Contrary to the respondents' interpretation, paragraph (a) of the statute directs the Government to consider the acquisition of &ldquo;all software&rdquo; and &ldquo;related materials&rdquo; necessary to satisfy the Government's needs for certain activities throughout the life cycle of the noncommercial software being acquired, without any

                        limitations on commerciality of the additional software or related materials. <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/4576" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paragraph (b)(2) of 10 U.S.C. 4576</a> also indicates that the software deliverables should not rely on external or additional software with no limitations with respect to commerciality of that external or additional software. Similar to the respondents' comments about commercial software, paragraph (b) of the statute explicitly acknowledges circumstances where delivery of software is not feasible. In such cases, the statute and the final rule acknowledge alternative deliverable requirements. Accordingly, the statute may be applied to both noncommercial and commercial software, and the statute considers how DoD may consider and protect the intellectual property (IP) interests of its industry partners (including commercial vendors and nontraditional contractors).
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-18" data-page="17341">DoD asserts that application of the statutory requirements for the Government to consider acquiring all of the additional software and related materials necessary to meet the Government's needs for deploying, operating, testing, and supporting acquired software over its life cycle is consistent with long-standing policy regarding the acquisition of commercial software. DoD's established policies and practices for acquiring commercial computer software and related documentation recognize that the Government may negotiate for additional deliverables and license rights that are necessary to meet the Government's needs when the standard commercial deliverables or rights do not meet agency needs (see DFARS 227.7202-1(a) and (c) and 227.7202-3(b)). For these reasons, DoD asserts that the final rule should apply to commercial software and documentation, while maintaining the policies set forth in DFARS 227.7202-1(c). The final rule has been revised to emphasize consistency with DFARS 227.7202-1(c), while permitting contracting officers the discretion to consider the factors identified in DFARS 227.7203-2(b) and (c), unless inappropriate under the specific circumstances of the acquisition. Because the final rule is consistent with the policies at DFARS 227.7202-1(c), this facilitates alignment with commercial licensing models, thereby incentivizing commercial vendors to do business with DoD.</p>
                    <p id="p-19" data-page="17341">In response to the respondents' concerns about the scope of the term &ldquo;all necessary license rights&rdquo; in DFARS 227.7203-2(b)(6)(ii)(A) and (B), this phrase has been changed to &ldquo;license rights sufficient to meet the Government's needs.&rdquo; The final rule is consistent with the policies and directives at DFARS 227.7203 and Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 5010.44, Intellectual Property (IP) Acquisition and Licensing, which encourage contracting officers to tailor the Government's license rights to the meet agency needs.</p>

                    <p id="p-20" data-page="17341">
                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         Several respondents recommended that the proposed rule should retain the term &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; in the phrase &ldquo;the Government's minimum needs&rdquo; in DFARS 227.7103-2(b)(1) and 227.7203-2(b)(1). The respondents asserted that removal of this term will be construed as expanding the scope of the Government's needs and encouraging an unbounded consideration of life-cycle needs. The respondents asserted that the Government may risk overpricing its requirements, based on an overly expansive interpretation of the proposed rule. The respondents also posited that an unbounded assessment of life-cycle needs may not consider obsolescence of software due to various factors, including future changes to hardware and software specifications, entrances and exits of software vendors to the market, and new disruptive technologies. One of the respondents also noted that the phrase &ldquo;the Government's minimum needs&rdquo; reflects long-standing DFARS policy, which was recommended by the Section 807 Committee in 1995.

                        <em>Response:</em>
                         DoD notes that the proposed revisions were made partially in response to recommendations made in Tension Point Paper 2 in the 2018 Report Government-Industry Advisory Panel on Technical Data Rights (the &ldquo;Section 813 Panel Final Report&rdquo;). In response to the advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) published at <a href="/citation/85-FR-2101" class="fr-reference" data-reference="85 FR 2101">85 FR 2101</a> on January 14, 2020, one respondent previously recommended that DoD should adopt the recommendations in Tension Point Paper 2. In Tension Point Paper 2, the Government and industry panel members recommended that the term &ldquo;minimum needs&rdquo; should be changed to &ldquo;lifecycle needs&rdquo; in the context of the Government determining its needs, including consideration of alternatives to traditional delivery methods.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-22" data-page="17341">As acknowledged by respondents during the public meeting held on March 10, 2022, there are long-standing concerns that the phrase &ldquo;the Government's minimum needs&rdquo; and the term &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; in particular, are ambiguous and purportedly misunderstood by contracting officers. Accordingly, the final rule removes the source of the ambiguity by removing &ldquo;minimum needs&rdquo; and replacing it with &ldquo;life-cycle needs.&rdquo; In addition, the phrase &ldquo;the Government's life-cycle needs&rdquo; is aligned with the recitation of &ldquo;life cycle&rdquo; in <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/4576" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 4576</a>, which does not reference &ldquo;minimum needs.&rdquo; The statute supersedes recommendations made by the Section 807 Committee nearly three decades ago.</p>
                    <p id="p-23" data-page="17341">In response to the respondents' concerns about the scope of the term &ldquo;life-cycle needs,&rdquo; DoD notes that the assessment of life-cycle needs is informed and shaped by the considerations and factors in DFARS 227.7103-2(b)(1) and 227.7203-2(b)(1). The final rule further bolsters the list of factors in DFARS 227.7203-2(b)(1)(i) by including the Government's costs to develop computer software.</p>

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent expressed concerns that the proposed changes to DFARS 227.7202-1(d) and 227.7203-2(b) and (c) do not adequately address the complex state of software development across innovative, cloud-based technology firms. Another respondent asserted that the proposed rule disregards the value of the IP and investment of software developers. This respondent recommended that the final rule consider how acquisition requirements will impact the willingness of businesses (and specifically small businesses) to do business with the Government. The respondent suggested that DoD's assessments of life-cycle needs should consider incentives for traditional and nontraditional contractors (such as small businesses) to continue to develop computer software solutions at private expense for Government applications and to submit bids for Government contracts.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-25" data-page="17341">Another respondent recommended that the proposed rule at DFARS 227.7203-2(b)(2)(ii) should be changed to require consideration of the alternatives to delivery of source code and related software design details listed in DFARS 227.7203-2(b)(2)(ii), rather than merely recommending consideration of alternatives. One respondent also recommended changing the title of this section to &ldquo;Alternatives to delivery of source code and related software design details.&rdquo;</p>

                        businesses and nontraditional contractors), while considering DoD's investments and life-cycle needs. Accordingly, DoD adopted several of the respondents' recommendations. In particular, DFARS 227.7203-2(b)(1)(i) was revised to emphasize the economic interests of small businesses and nontraditional contractors. The final rule also clarifies guidance in the proposed rule related to access to technical data or computer software. The final rule references &ldquo;access agreements for cloud-based or subscription-based software products or services&rdquo; as an alternative to delivery of source code and design details in DFARS 227.7203-2(b)(2)(ii). The final rule also changes the title of DFARS 227.7203-2(b)(2)(ii), as recommended.

                    <p id="p-27" data-page="17342">However, DoD has not adopted the respondent's recommendation to change the prescriptive guidance at DFARS 227.7203-2(b)(2)(ii) to require consideration of these alternatives to source code and related software design details. In accordance with FAR 2.101, the term &ldquo;should&rdquo; denotes that the instruction will be followed unless inappropriate for a particular circumstance. As acknowledged by various respondents, DoD must consider the feasibility or practicality of applying these policies. To that end, the term &ldquo;should&rdquo; provides contracting officers with the flexibility to consider the specific circumstances or nuances of an acquisition in applying the considerations in DFARS 227.7203-2(b)(2)(ii).</p>

                         Some respondents recommended that the proposed rule at DFARS 237.102 should not apply to service contracts, such as software-as-a-service contracts.

                         DoDI 5000.74, Defense Acquisition of Services, indicates that IP needs must be addressed in acquisition strategies for service contracts. DoDI 5010.44 also indicates that acquisition, licensing, and management of IP is an important factor in acquisition, operation, maintenance, modernization, and sustainment, whether the IP is delivered as a product or as a service. In view of these DoD policies, the prescriptive guidance at DFARS 237.102 merely notes that contracting officers should consider the guidance in 227.7202 and 227.7203, and references existing, long-standing DFARS guidance. For these reasons, DoD has not adopted the respondents' recommendation that the rule should not apply to service contracts.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         Several respondents asserted that the revisions to the definition of &ldquo;restricted rights&rdquo; should be removed. The respondents asserted that the proposed revisions: (1) do not balance the interests of Government and industry; (2) conflict with existing DoD policies and statutes; and (3) are vague and internally inconsistent with respect to the terms &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;, &ldquo;development&rdquo;, and &ldquo;use&rdquo;. Several respondents indicated that the proposed rule does not adequately protect the developer's economic interests in software developed exclusively at private expense. Some respondents asserted that the proposed rule may impact the economic interests of small businesses and that it will discourage ongoing private investment and the delivery of privately developed software. The respondents also asserted that the proposed rule conflicts with existing DoD policies and statutes (

                        <em>Response:</em>
                         DoD notes that the revisions to the &ldquo;restricted rights&rdquo; definition were made partially in response to recommendations made in Tension Point Paper 13 in the Section 813 Panel Final Report. In response to the ANPR published at <a href="/citation/85-FR-2101" class="fr-reference" data-reference="85 FR 2101">85 FR 2101</a> on January 14, 2020, one respondent previously recommended that DoD should adopt the recommendation in Tension Point Paper 13. In Tension Point Paper 13, industry panel members agreed that the definition of &ldquo;restricted rights&rdquo; should be revised to permit the Government to make a &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; number of copies to satisfy the Government's life-cycle needs, including DoD's programmatic and operational needs. Although the respondents indicated that the term &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; is unbounded or vague, DoD notes that the current term &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; is also not limited or defined by a specific number of software copies. For these reasons, DoD has not adopted the respondents' recommendation to reinstate the phrase &ldquo;minimum number of copies.&rdquo;
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-32" data-page="17342">The proposed rule changed the number of copies that the Government is permitted to make for otherwise-authorized activities. The proposed rule does not expand the Government's license rights to distribute or use computer software. Because there are no purpose-based limitations on the Government's use of computer programs in paragraph (i) of the &ldquo;restricted rights&rdquo; definition, a &ldquo;restricted rights&rdquo; license permits Government use of computer programs for any purpose. Accordingly, the proposed rule included revisions that sought to reference and provide examples of the Government's authorized purposes and activities provided within the existing rights under the definition of &ldquo;restricted rights.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p id="p-33" data-page="17342">For clarity, DoD revised paragraph (iii) of these definitions by: (1) removing the additional listing of specific, exemplary purposes included in the proposed rule; (2) removing the reference to &ldquo;use&rdquo; of computer software; and (3) permitting copies for &ldquo;other activities authorized in [the `restricted rights' definition]&rdquo; to leverage existing rights under the clauses. The final rule also resolves an ambiguity in the &ldquo;restricted rights&rdquo; definition. Although the current rule expressly recognizes the Government's rights to use computer programs for any purpose in paragraph (i) of the definition, the rule only implicitly recognizes the Government's rights to use unmodified computer software for the specific purposes and activities for which the license expressly authorizes the software to be released to non-Government persons. To resolve this ambiguity, DoD revised paragraphs (v) through (vii) to expressly indicate that the Government has the right to use computer software for those same purposes, as well as other rights to computer software already provided to covered Government support contractors.</p>

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         Although the respondent acknowledged that this recommendation is outside the scope of implementing <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/4576" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 4576</a>, the respondent recommended that DoD's future rulemaking address the specific Government-industry recommendations included in Tension Point Paper 12 of the Section 813 Panel Final Report. In particular, the respondent recommended that DoD should, in a separate rule, consider DFARS revisions that identify factors to be considered in determining whether to adopt a traditional acquisition approach or a software-as-a-service approach.
