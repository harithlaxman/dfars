                <p id="p-6" data-page="52348">
                    DoD published a proposed rule in the 
                    <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                     at <a href="/citation/87-FR-11009" class="fr-reference" data-reference="87 FR 11009">87 FR 11009</a> on February 28, 2022, to revise the DFARS to implement section 872 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/116/public/92" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 116-92</a>). Section 872 modifies subsection (j) of section 831 of the NDAA for FY 1991 (Pub. L. 101-510) to reauthorize and improve the DoD Mentor-Prot&eacute;g&eacute; Program. Section 872 extends the date for entering into a mentor-prot&eacute;g&eacute; agreement, extends the date for reimbursement of mentors, limits the term for program participation, extends the date for a mentor to receive credit toward the attainment of small business subcontracting goals, and expands eligibility for prot&eacute;g&eacute; firms. One respondent submitted a public comment in response to the proposed rule.

                <p id="p-9" data-page="52348">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     One respondent indicated a conditional individual waiver(s) to the nonmanufacturing rule should be issued in conjunction with the extended DoD Mentor-Prot&eacute;g&eacute; Program through September 30, 2024.

                <p id="p-10" data-page="52348">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     This is outside the scope of the rule. Individual waivers to the nonmanufacturer rule are addressed at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 19.505(c)(4)(B) and <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-13/section-121.1203" class="cfr external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">13 CFR 121.1203</a>.
                </p>
                <h3 id="h-11">C. Other Changes</h3>
                <p id="p-11" data-page="52348">A change was made at DFARS Appendix I, I-101, Definitions, to delete the definitions for minority institution of higher education, women-owned small business, and service-disabled veteran-owned small business. These terms are already defined in FAR part 2, and the definitions in FAR part 2 apply to the DFARS unless otherwise stated. Minor editorial changes were made at DFARS 219.7101 and 219.7102. No other changes were made from the proposed rule.</p>
                <h2 id="h-12">III. Applicability to Contracts at or Below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold and for Commercial Services and Commercial Products, Including Commercially Available Off-the-Shelf Items</h2>
                <p id="p-12" data-page="52348">This rule does not create any new solicitation provisions or contract clauses. It does not impact any existing provisions or clauses or their applicability to contracts at or below the simplified acquisition threshold and acquisitions of commercial services and commercial products, including commercially available off-the-shelf items.</p>
                <h2 id="h-13">IV. Expected Impact of the Rule</h2>
                <p id="p-13" data-page="52348">This rule implements section 872 of the NDAA for FY 2020, which reauthorizes and improves the DoD Mentor-Prot&eacute;g&eacute; program. The purpose of the program is to provide incentives to major DoD contractors to furnish eligible small business concerns with assistance designed to&mdash;</p>
                <p id="p-14" data-page="52348">(1) Enhance the capabilities of small business concerns to perform as subcontractors and suppliers under DoD contracts and other contracts and subcontracts; and</p>
                <p id="p-15" data-page="52348">(2) Increase the participation of such business concerns as subcontractors and suppliers under DoD contracts, other Federal Government contracts, and commercial contracts.</p>
                <p id="p-16" data-page="52348">Therefore, this rule will benefit small business concerns by extending the opportunity to enter into DoD mentor-prot&eacute;g&eacute; agreements. In addition, the eligibility of small business concerns is expanded as this rule removes prior restrictions for eligibility by aligning the size of the small business with the size standard associated with its primary North American Industry Classification System code. This rule is also expected to benefit large entities and the Government by expanding the defense industrial base.</p>
                <h2 id="h-14">V. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563</h2>
                <p id="p-17" data-page="52348">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under Section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993.</p>

                    . The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has determined that this rule is not a major rule as defined by <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/804" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 804</a>.

                <h2 id="h-16">VII. Regulatory Flexibility Act</h2>
                <p id="p-19" data-page="52349">
                    A final regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>, 
                    <em>et seq.</em>
                     The final regulatory flexibility analysis is summarized as follows:
                </p>
                <p id="p-20" data-page="52349">This final rule is necessary to implement section 872 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/116/public/92" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 116-92</a>). The objective of this rule is to implement section 872, which reauthorizes and improves the DoD Mentor-Prot&eacute;g&eacute; Program (Program). The authority for entering into new agreements expired on September 30, 2018. This rule extends the date for new mentor-prot&eacute;g&eacute; agreements to September 30, 2024. This rule also extends the date for reimbursement of incurred costs under the Program to September 30, 2026, as well as the date for costs to be applied to a mentor's subcontracting plan goals. The eligibility of a small business concern, as related to the Program, is also modified to align with the size standard associated with its primary North American Industry Classification System code.</p>
                <p id="p-21" data-page="52349">No comments were received in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis.</p>
                <p id="p-22" data-page="52349">The number of ongoing DoD mentor-prot&eacute;g&eacute; agreements in FY 2018 and FY 2019 was 90, four of which expired in FY 2019. No new agreements were entered into in FY 2019 since the authority to enter into agreements expired on September 30, 2018. The number of ongoing agreements in FY 2020 was 86, 29 of which expired. As of June 2021, there were 57 ongoing agreements, 50 new agreements, and 12 expiring agreements, with a total of 95. DoD estimates 66 new agreements will be entered into in FY 2022, 82 in FY 2023, and 98 in FY 2024.</p>
                <p id="p-23" data-page="52349">This rule does not impose any new reporting, recordkeeping, or other compliance requirements for small entities.</p>
                <p id="p-24" data-page="52349">DoD did not identify any significant alternatives that would minimize or reduce the impact on small entities. Any impact is expected to be beneficial.</p>
                <h2 id="h-17">VIII. Paperwork Reduction Act</h2>
                <p id="p-25" data-page="52349">The Paperwork Reduction Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/44/3501" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44 U.S.C. chapter 35</a>) does apply; however, these changes to the DFARS do not impose additional information collection requirements to the paperwork burden previously approved under OMB Control Number 0704-0332.</p>
