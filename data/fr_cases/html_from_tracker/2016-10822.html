                    DoD published an interim rule in the 
                    <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                     at <a href="/citation/79-FR-11337" class="fr-reference" data-reference="79 FR 11337">79 FR 11337</a> on February 28, 2014, to implement section 802 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/112/public/81" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub.

                <p id="p-9" data-page="28725">1. A new paragraph (b)(4) is added to the provision at DFARS 252.204-7013 and a new paragraph (b)(5) is added to the clause at DFARS 252.204-7014 to clarify that the offeror and the contractor, respectively, shall destroy or return to the Government, at the request of the contracting officer, all litigation information in its possession upon completion of the authorized litigation support activities.</p>

                <p id="p-11" data-page="28725">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     One respondent commented that the interim rule went beyond the definition of &ldquo;sensitive information&rdquo; provided in <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/129d" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 129d</a> because, as implemented, &ldquo;sensitive information&rdquo; is not limited to information owned by the Department of Defense. The respondent suggested that the absence of the language &ldquo;obtained from a person&rdquo; as used in Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/552" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4)</a>) indicates that <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/129d" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 129d</a> was intended to apply only to information &ldquo;owned by the Department of Defense.&rdquo; The respondent stated that because the interim rule does not limit the scope of sensitive information to only information owned by DoD, the rule could expose the Government to liability or penalties for unauthorized disclosure of information under the Federal Tort Claims Act, or a taking of property under the U.S. Constitution, the Procurement Integrity Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/2101" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 2101</a> 
                    <em>et seq.,</em>
                     and the Trade Secrets Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/18/1905" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">18 U.S.C. 1905</a>. The respondent called for rescission of the interim rule until the definition of &ldquo;sensitive information&rdquo; was narrowed.
                </p>
                <p id="p-12" data-page="28725">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The statutory language and legislative history do not indicate that <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/129d" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 129d</a> is limited only to information owned by the Department of Defense (or the U.S. Government). Prior to, and notwithstanding, the enactment of the statute, DoD was authorized to disclose information that it owns. <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/129d" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 129d</a> authorizes disclosure of &ldquo;sensitive information,&rdquo; without limitation related to the ownership or source of the information, for the sole purpose of providing litigation support to DoD. To narrow the definition as the respondent suggests would obviate the need for any statutory authorization. The new DFARS subpart 204.74 established by the interim rule implements the statutory authorization for litigation information, including sensitive information owned by or obtained from non-DoD sources. Disclosure of such information is thus authorized by law when done pursuant to DFARS subpart 204.74. No change is made in the final rule.

                <p id="p-13" data-page="28725">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     One respondent questioned whether litigation support contractors, and their subcontractors, will be required to comply with the requirements at DFARS clause 252.204-7012, formerly entitled &ldquo;Safeguarding of Unclassified Controlled Technical Information.&rdquo;

                <p id="p-14" data-page="28725">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The requirements of the clause at DFARS 252.204-7012, now entitled &ldquo;Safeguarding Covered Defense Information and Cyber Incident Reporting,&rdquo; will apply to contractors, and their subcontractors, as required by the clause.

                <p id="p-15" data-page="28725">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     One respondent suggested that the interim rule should be amended to include requirements for the information provided to a litigation support contractor to be destroyed or returned to DoD when no longer needed or at the end of contract performance.

                <h4 id="h-14">4. Use of Litigation Information</h4>
                <p id="p-17" data-page="28725">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     One respondent suggested limiting the authorized use of litigation information to the litigation support required by the individual contract, under which the litigation information was received.
                </p>
                <p id="p-18" data-page="28725">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     Litigation support contractors must be able to use the litigation information provided by the Government as needed. A contractor may provide litigation support under multiple contracts. In such instances, limiting the scope of authorized use to only the contract under which the litigation information was provided could require the Government to provide the same information multiple times. Having to exchange and handle multiple copies of the same information increases the risk of inadvertent disclosure and the cost of performance and administration. No change is made in the final rule.
                </p>
                <h4 id="h-15">5. Third Party Beneficiary Rights</h4>
                <p id="p-19" data-page="28725">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     One respondent stated that if &ldquo;sensitive information&rdquo; includes information owned by third parties, then the interim rule should be amended to require litigation support contractors to comply with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 9.505-4(b) and have a direct nondisclosure agreement between the owner of the sensitive information and the litigation support contractor. The respondent also stated that the third party beneficiary rights are illusory without notice to the owner of the sensitive information.
                </p>
                <p id="p-20" data-page="28725">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     A direct nondisclosure agreement or prior notice requirement could prejudice the Government by providing premature warning of possible litigation or of the Government's litigation strategies. Accordingly, DoD has determined that requiring a direct nondisclosure agreement pursuant to FAR 9.505-4(b) for litigation support contractors would not be in the Government's interest. <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/129d" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 129d</a> does not require that DoD confer upon an owner of sensitive information any third party beneficiary rights; however, at paragraph (d) of the clause at 252.204-7014, DoD has chosen to provide third party beneficiary rights analogous to those afforded by paragraph (c) of the clause at DFARS 252.227-7025. No change is made in the final rule as a result of this comment.
                </p>
                <h4 id="h-16">6. Appropriateness of an Interim Rule</h4>
                <p id="p-21" data-page="28725">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     One respondent stated that issuing an interim rule was not appropriate because there was inadequate justification for the determination of urgent or compelling reasons for doing so. The respondent suggested that, without further justification, a proposed rule was more appropriate and urged rescission of the interim rule.
                </p>
                <p id="p-22" data-page="28725">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     DoD published the basis for its determination that urgent and compelling reasons existed to authorize the use of an interim rule. After consideration of the respondent's comment, DoD determined that rescission of the interim rule was not warranted.
                </p>
                <h4 id="h-17">7. Release of Information to Litigation Support Subcontractors</h4>
                <p id="p-23" data-page="28725">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     One respondent stated that while litigation support contractors are required to flow down the clause at DFARS 252.204-7014 to subcontractors, 
                    <span class="printed-page-inline unprinted-element document-markup" data-page="28726">

                    it is not clear whether litigation support contractors and any subcontractors would be subject to DFARS clause 252.204-7000, Disclosure of Information.
                </p>
                <p id="p-24" data-page="28726">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     This rule does not affect the applicability of the clause DFARS at 252.204-7000. In accordance with its prescription at DFARS 204.404-70(a), the clause applies to all solicitations and contracts when the contractor will have access to or generate unclassified information that may be sensitive and inappropriate for release to the public. That clause will flow down to subcontracts, in accordance with paragraph (c) of the clause. There is no conflict between the DFARS 252.204-7000 clause and the DFARS 252.204-7014 clause, at the prime or subcontract level. The clause at DFARS 252.204-7000 prohibits the release of information outside the contractor's organization without permission from the contracting officer, while the DFARS 252.204-7014 clause requires the litigation support contractor to protect against any unauthorized releases of information, and does not authorize the contractor to make any releases outside the contractor's organization. However, to minimize any potential confusion, paragraph (b)(2) is added to the DFARS 252.204-7014 clause to state more clearly that it does not authorize the contractor to release litigation information outside the contractor's organization without permission of the contracting officer. Contracting officers, in conjunction with the Government litigation team, maintain control over the flow of information to litigation support contractors and outside parties.

                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     One respondent pointed out that the prescription in the interim rule at DFARS 204.7403(c) would have precluded DFARS 252.204-7015 from ever being included in a contract.

                <p id="p-27" data-page="28726">A summary of revisions made to the rule to make necessary conforming changes, clarifications, and editorial changes follows:</p>
                <h4 id="h-20">1. Definitions</h4>
                <p id="p-28" data-page="28726">a. The definition of &ldquo;litigation information&rdquo; is revised to clarify that information contained in publicly available solicitations will not be protected from disclosure as litigation information, because the information has already been released to the public. A corresponding policy statement is also added at DFARS 204.7402(c).</p>
                <p id="p-29" data-page="28726">
                    b. A policy statement is added at DFARS 204.7402(d) to state that contracting officers, when sharing sensitive information with a litigation support contractor, shall ensure that all other applicable requirements for handling and safeguarding the relevant types of sensitive information re included in the contract (
                    <em>e.g.,</em>
                     FAR subparts 4.4 and 24.1; DFARS subparts 204.4 and 224.1).
                </p>
                <p id="p-30" data-page="28726">c. The definition of &ldquo;litigation support contractor&rdquo; is revised to clarify that, in addition to experts and technical consultants, the term also includes the contractor's subcontractors and suppliers. The text &ldquo;the Department of Defense&rdquo; is also removed, since the clause is only used in DoD contracts.</p>
                <p id="p-31" data-page="28726">d. DFARS subpart 204.74, the provision at 252.204-7013, and the clauses at 252.204-7014 and 252.204-7015 are revised to include the full text of all relevant definitions, rather than cross-referencing the definitions that were provided in full-text only in the contract clause at DFARS 252.204-7014. Further, the definition of &ldquo;sensitive information&rdquo; is clarified by removing the term &ldquo;confidential information&rdquo; and replacing it with &ldquo;controlled unclassified information&rdquo; in subpart 204.74, the provision, and the clauses.</p>
                <h4 id="h-21">2. Conforming Changes</h4>
                <p id="p-32" data-page="28726">a. A conforming change has been made to DFARS 209.505-4(b)(i) in order to differentiate between the requirements that pertain to litigation support contractors from the requirements for other contractors, consistent with the changes in this rule.</p>
                <p id="p-33" data-page="28726">b. DFARS 209.505-4(b)(ii) is added to clarify the policies and procedures (set forth in 204.74 and associated provisions and clauses) governing access to proprietary information for litigation support activities as an element of the coverage for organizational and consultant conflicts of interest.</p>

Based on data available in the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) for FY 2015, 421 of the 453 total DoD awards for professional attorney services or associated legal services were valued at less than the SAT. An exception for contracts valued at or under the SAT would exclude a large portion (93 percent) of the contracts intended to be covered by section 802, thereby undermining the overarching public policy purpose of the law and adversely affecting the Government's ability to successfully engage in legal proceedings.

                <p id="p-42" data-page="28727">Given that the requirements of section 802 of the NDAA for FY 2008 were enacted to protect sensitive information provided to DoD litigation support contractors from unauthorized use and disclosure, DoD has determined that it is in the best interest of the Federal Government to apply the rule to contracts for the acquisition of commercial items, as defined at FAR 2.101. Based on data available in FPDS for FY 2015, 352 of the 453 total DoD awards for legal support services were classified as commercial contracts.

This is a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993. This rule is not a major rule under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/804" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 804</a>.</p>

                <p id="p-44" data-page="28727">
                    DoD does not expect this final rule to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>, 
                    <em>et seq.</em>
                     However, a final regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared and is summarized as follows:
                </p>
                <p id="p-45" data-page="28727">This rule amends the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) to implement statutory authority (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/129d" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 129d</a>) for DoD to allow its litigation support contractors to have access to &ldquo;sensitive information,&rdquo; provided that the litigation support contractor is subject to certain restrictions on using and disclosing such information.</p>
                <p id="p-46" data-page="28727">The objective of the rule is to expressly authorize DoD to provide its ligation support contractors with access to certain types of non-public information, provided that the ligation support contractors are required to protect that information from any unauthorized disclosure, and are prohibited from using that for any purpose other than providing litigation support services to DoD.</p>
                <p id="p-47" data-page="28727">No significant issues were raised by the public comments in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis published with the interim rule.</p>
                <p id="p-48" data-page="28727">According to data available in the Federal Procurement Data System for fiscal year 2015, DoD awarded 453 total contracts for legal support services to 212 unique vendors. Of those awards, 340 awards or 75 percent were made to 162 small businesses.</p>
                <p id="p-49" data-page="28727">The rule imposes no reporting, recordkeeping, or other information collection requirements; rather, the rule subjects litigation support contractors to certain restrictions on using and disclosing litigation support information. DoD organizations using litigation support contractors are generally already using very restrictive nondisclosure agreements to govern any sensitive information that may be provided to, or developed or discovered by, the litigation support contractors in providing litigation support services for DoD. These DoD organizations will likely review their current practices and make any necessary modifications to ensure that there are no inconsistencies with the new requirements. As such, DoD does not expect the rule to have a significant economic impact on the small businesses affected by this rule.</p>
                <p id="p-50" data-page="28727">There are no known significant alternatives to the rule. The impact of this rule on small business is not expected to be significant.</p>
