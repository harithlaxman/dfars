                <h2 id="h-7">I. Background</h2>
                <p id="p-7" data-page="52253">
                    DoD published an interim rule in the 
                    <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                     at <a href="/citation/77-FR-19127" class="fr-reference" data-reference="77 FR 19127">77 FR 19127</a> on March 30, 2012, to implement section 814(b) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/112/public/81" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 112-81</a>). The interim rule adjusted the dollar limitation on the acquisition of right-hand drive passenger sedans from $30,000 per vehicle to $40,000 per vehicle, and included this dollar limitation on the list of statutory acquisition-related dollar thresholds subject to inflation adjustment in accordance with the requirements of <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1908" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1908</a>. One respondent submitted a public comment in response to the interim rule.
                </p>
                <h2 id="h-8">II. Discussion and Analysis of the Public Comments</h2>
                <p id="p-8" data-page="52253">The respondent concurred with the inflation threshold increase listed at DFARS 212.271. There were no comments suggesting changes to the interim rule. Therefore, DoD is finalizing the interim rule without change.</p>
                <h2 id="h-9">III. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563</h2>
                <p id="p-9" data-page="52253">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993. This rule is not a major rule under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/804" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 804</a>.</p>
                <h2 id="h-10">IV. Regulatory Flexibility Act</h2>
                <p id="p-10" data-page="52253">DoD certifies that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>, et seq., because it merely adjusts upward the current limitation for acquisition of right-hand drive passenger vehicles from $30,000 to $40,000 due to inflation.</p>
                <h2 id="h-11">V. Paperwork Reduction Act</h2>
                <p id="p-11" data-page="52253">The rule does not contain any information collection requirements that require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/44/3501" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44 U.S.C. chapter 35</a>).</p>
