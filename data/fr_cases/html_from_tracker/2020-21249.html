                     One respondent suggested removal of the words &ldquo;when purchased,&rdquo; which were added as a clarification to the statutory text in the proposed rule, suggesting that the addition &ldquo;serves only to erode the purpose of the law, and will increase administrative burden of identifying comingled items.&rdquo;

                    address the common situation in which a contractor purchases items in bulk, intending to use the items for its general business, as distinguished from a specific subcontract, identifiable at the time of purchase with a specific prime contract. This is consistent with the legislative history quoted by the respondent with regard to cases where contractors often place orders with subcontractors for material, supplies, and parts that may be applicable to several Government programs in advance of any Government contract or RFP. The text of the enactment is fully consistent with this interpretation: &ldquo;items . . . that are 
                    <em>purchased by a contractor for use in the performance of multiple contracts</em>
                     with the Department of Defense and other parties and are not identifiable to any particular contract.&rdquo; The language &ldquo;when purchased&rdquo; was added to avoid a possible application to items that were in fact purchased for specific purposes, as subcontracts subject to the wide range of contract terms that the purchaser might be required to &ldquo;flow down&rdquo; to the particular subcontracts. Many of those &ldquo;flow down&rdquo; clauses are required by other laws, or otherwise reflect important procurement policies, and any exceptions must be applied narrowly. It is contrary to the intent of the underlying laws if those items are to be &ldquo;treated as commercial items&rdquo; on the sole basis that after acquisition, the prime contractor commingles them with other materials in inventory, whether by policy or in error, so that they lose their &ldquo;identification.&rdquo;

                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     In connection with this issue, one respondent suggested that DoD define the term &ldquo;identifiable to any particular contract&rdquo; as stated. The respondent argued that this is &ldquo;in the Government's best interest&rdquo; on the basis of an example in which the prime contractor purchases items in bulk, apparently &ldquo;for use in the performance of multiple contracts with the Department of Defense and other parties.&rdquo; In the example, the items are &ldquo;identifiable to any particular contract&rdquo; only to the extent that DPAS ratings are &ldquo;flowed down&rdquo; to the supplier as to a small proportion of the total quantity purchased. On this basis, the respondent suggests, while the subcontract order did not identify any particular items as designated for the DPAS-rated prime contract; the items are physically indistinguishable from each other; and they will be commingled in inventory; yet because the 
                    <em>costs</em>
                     of the few items will be allocable to the particular prime contract, they will be considered &ldquo;identifiable to [the] particular contract&rdquo; and thus effectively excluded from the coverage of <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2380b" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2380b</a> unless the suggested amendment is adopted.

                <p id="p-15" data-page="60919">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     This clarification is unnecessary. The Congressional intent to allow contractors to buy relatively low-value items in bulk, for various customers, appears to be directly applicable to the described situation. There is no single definition of the term &ldquo;identifiable,&rdquo; as used in the NDAA, but the statute is written in regard to items, not the cost of the items. DoD does not consider that unspecified items procured as part of a bulk purchase for multiple customers are &ldquo;identifiable to [a] particular contract&rdquo; on the sole basis that a related portion of the cost is allocable to the contract.
                </p>
                <p id="p-16" data-page="60919">There may, however, be other bases on which particular items or subdivisions of a single purchase may be identifiable with a particular contract, and creating a criterion that the items must be identifiable by individual serial number is not warranted.</p>

                <p id="p-18" data-page="60919">Comment: One respondent suggested that the quoted language &ldquo;would require specific clauses to be applied &lsquo;after the fact&rsquo; in direct conflict with Section 877 and negate its intent.&rdquo;</p>
                <p id="p-19" data-page="60919">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     Section 877 only specifies that the items shall be treated as commercial items. It is not in conflict with section 877 to state that items treated as commercial items must comply with requirements that are applicable to commercial items. The respondent is apparently concerned that because the items are not purchased for a specific Government contract, that the contractor will not have imposed Government requirements upon the suppliers. The proposed language simply clarifies that if certain items are to be &ldquo;treated as commercial items&rdquo; pursuant to the first sentence and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2380b" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2380b</a>, on the basis that they are &ldquo;valued under $10,000 and [were] purchased by a contractor for use in the performance of multiple contracts with the Department of Defense and other parties and are not identifiable to any particular contract,&rdquo; then in place of clauses that might otherwise apply, the items must comply with the clauses that apply to commercial items. If the respondent is suggesting that section 877, by providing that the items are to be &ldquo;treated as commercial items,&rdquo; was intended to further excuse a contractor from compliance with the clauses identified in FAR 52.244-6(c) (and any authorized agency supplements), DoD disagrees. One of the criteria for an acceptable purchasing system requires the contractor to ensure that all applicable purchase orders and subcontracts contain all flowdown clauses . . . needed to carry out the requirements of the prime contract (DFARS 252.244-7001(c)(2)).

                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     One respondent suggested that the term &ldquo;shall be treated as commercial items&rdquo; be supplemented by adding language to the effect that &ldquo;treatment&rdquo; of an item as a commercial item under the authority provided in <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2380b" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2380b</a> means that FAR part 12 applies, as it would apply under the proposed rule applicable to <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1903" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1903</a>, Special Emergency Procurement Authority, and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2380a" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2380a</a>, Treatment of Services Provided by Nontraditional Contractors as Commercial Items.

                    <em>Response:</em><a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1903" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1903</a> provides that in defined circumstances in which its &ldquo;special emergency procurement authority&rdquo; applies, an executive agency &ldquo;may treat the property or service as a commercial item for the purpose of carrying out the procurement.&rdquo; <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2380a" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2380a</a> provides the same &ldquo;treatment&rdquo; by an agency for items and services provided by nontraditional defense contractors. Both of these provisions apply to acquisitions by an agency. To the extent that an agency &ldquo;may treat the property or service as a commercial item for the purpose of carrying out the procurement,&rdquo; this logically implies application of FAR part 12 procedures. <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2380b" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2380b</a>, however, applies to purchases by a contractor. The requirements of FAR part 12 do not apply to purchases by a contractor, it would be extremely burdensome on contractors to make its requirements applicable, and DoD did not propose to do so.

                    <em>Response:</em>
                     This change is to conform to the DFARS drafting convention that provisions and clauses are the appropriate place to direct contractors to do something. The text of the DFARS that is not a provision or a clause is directed to the contracting officer. Therefore, DFARS 244.402(a) should not tell the contractor that it shall do something, but should inform the contracting officer of a requirement applicable to contractors.

The file documentation proposed under DFARS 212.102(iv)(C) to use either authority would be a representation by the subcontractor in accordance with DFARS 252.215-7013, and the prime contractor should be able to rely on such.

                <p id="p-43" data-page="60920">This rule proposes to modify the clause at DFARS 252.244,7000, Subcontracts for Commercial Items, but does not modify its applicability.

However, the amendment to DFARS 252.244-7000 proposed by this rule does not impose any burdens on contractors, but allows treatment of certain items as commercial items, that do not otherwise meet the definition of &ldquo;commercial item&rdquo; in FAR part 2.</p>

                <p id="p-47" data-page="60920">
                    This final rule is issued in order to implement sections 877 and 878 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2380a" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2380a</a> and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2380b" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2380b</a>).

                    treatment as commercial items of services provided by nontraditional defense contractors and certain items purchased by a contractor for use in the performance of multiple contracts. The legal basis for the rule is the NDAA section cited as the reasons for the action.
                </p>
                <p id="p-48" data-page="60921">There were no significant issues raised by the public comments in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis.</p>
                <p id="p-49" data-page="60921">Based on FY 2018 data from the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS), awards of commercial contracts were made to 15,231 nontraditional defense contractors that were also small entities. It is unknown how many of those entities might provide services that use the same pool of employees used for commercial customers and are priced using methodology similar to the methodology used for commercial pricing.</p>
                <p id="p-50" data-page="60921">Also based on FPDS data for FY 2018, DoD awarded 110,000 contracts for the purchase of supplies, commercial or noncommercial, exceeding $10,000, to 13,892 unique small entities. This rule will affect an unknown number of those 13,892 small entities, if such small entities purchase noncommercial items valued at less than $10,000 per item that are not identifiable to any particular contract when purchased and are for use in the performance of multiple contracts with DoD and other parties.</p>
                <p id="p-51" data-page="60921">This rule does not impose any new reporting, recordkeeping, or other compliance requirements. The rule does remind the contractor of the responsibility to ensure that items treated as commercial items pursuant to section 877 of the NDAA for FY 2017 that are to be used in the performance of the DoD contract meet all terms and conditions of the contract that are applicable to commercial items.</p>
                <p id="p-52" data-page="60921">DoD did not identify any significant alternatives that would minimize or reduce the significant economic impact on small entities, because there is no significant impact on small entities. Any impact is expected to be beneficial.</p>
