Specifically, the rule prohibits the use of telecommunications equipment or services from certain Chinese entities and from any other entities that the Secretary of Defense reasonably believes to be owned or controlled by, or otherwise connected to, the government of the People's Republic of China or the Russian Federation, as a substantial or essential component of any system, or as a critical technology as a part of any system.</p>

                <p id="p-6" data-page="3832">
                    DoD published an interim rule in the 
                    <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                     at <a href="/citation/84-FR-72231" class="fr-reference" data-reference="84 FR 72231">84 FR 72231</a> on December 31, 2019, to implement section 1656 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/115/public/91" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 115-91</a>). This final DFARS rule implements the section 1656 prohibition, partially implements section 889(a)(1)(A) of the NDAA for FY 2019 prohibitions for DoD, and is structured to align with the Federal Acquisition Regulation implementation of the section 889(a)(1)(A) Governmentwide prohibition. The final rule should increase security of systems and critical technology that is part of any system used to carry out the nuclear deterrence and homeland defense missions of DoD by prohibiting the use of telecommunications equipment or services from certain Chinese entities, and from any other entities that the Secretary of Defense reasonably believes to be owned or controlled by, or otherwise connected to, the government of the People's Republic of China or the Russian Federation. Three respondents submitted comments on the interim rule.

                <h2 id="h-8">II. Discussion and Analysis</h2>
                <p id="p-7" data-page="3832">DoD reviewed the public comments in the development of the final rule. Two changes were made to the rule as a result of those comments. A respondent expressed support for the rule. Some respondents expressed concern over the underlying intent of the statute and recommended changes to the rule text to provide specific examples related to definitions. While DoD recognizes the concerns identified by the respondents, most of the recommendations are not within the scope of the statute. The ability to provide examples within the rule text is limited by the statute, which does not provide examples. A discussion of the public comments is provided as follows:</p>

                    There are two changes from the interim rule. The changes amend DFARS clause 252.204-7018, Prohibition on the Acquisition of Covered Defense Telecommunications Equipment or Services, by extending: (1) The reporting timeframe for the discovery of covered defense

                <h4 id="h-11">1. Cost to the Public and Government</h4>
                <p id="p-9" data-page="3833">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     A respondent stated that the representation adds administration costs to the public and Government and will make it difficult for small businesses to work with the Government.
                </p>
                <p id="p-10" data-page="3833">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The interim rule imposed the least amount of burden necessary to implement the statutory requirements by including an annual representation that may be relied upon if a negative representation (
                    <em>i.e.,</em>
                     &ldquo;does not&rdquo;) is provided in lieu of an offer-by-offer representation.

                <h4 id="h-12">2. Reporting Timelines</h4>
                <p id="p-11" data-page="3833">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     Respondents recommended that the reporting timeline for the discovery of covered defense telecommunications equipment or services be extended beyond one business day and that the reporting timeline for the mitigation actions undertaken by the contractor be extended beyond ten days.
                </p>
                <p id="p-12" data-page="3833">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     Concur. The one-day and ten-day requirements for reporting to DIBNet are extended in the final rule to three days and thirty days, respectively.
                </p>
                <h4 id="h-13">3. Subcontract Reporting</h4>
                <p id="p-13" data-page="3833">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     Respondents recommended that contractors only report subcontractor's discovery of covered defense telecommunications equipment or services that have &ldquo;credible information&rdquo;.
                </p>
                <p id="p-14" data-page="3833">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The clause flow down requires that entities at all tiers report the discovery of covered defense telecommunications equipment or services to the higher tier subcontractor or prime contractor. If the higher tier subcontractor or prime contractor does not report lower tier notifications of the discovery of covered defense telecommunications equipment or services, the higher tier subcontractor and prime contractor are at risk of being in violation of the prohibition.
                </p>
                <h4 id="h-14">4. Flowdown Requirements</h4>
                <p id="p-15" data-page="3833">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     Respondents recommended that the subcontract flow down to &ldquo;all subcontracts&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;all subcontracts and other contractual instruments&rdquo;.
                </p>
                <p id="p-16" data-page="3833">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The statutory authority does not provide an exception for vendor agreements or suppliers that are not considered subcontractors; therefore, the flow down to &ldquo;other contractual instruments&rdquo; is required by the statute.
                </p>
                <h4 id="h-15">5. List of Subsidiaries and Affiliates</h4>
                <p id="p-17" data-page="3833">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     Respondents recommended that DoD provide a publicly available list of the subsidiaries and affiliates against which to evaluate compliance. A respondent recommended that the list of subsidiaries and affiliates be included in DIBNet in coordination with the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs and recommended this list use the Department of Commerce list of affiliates and subsidiaries for Huawei. Another respondent recommended DoD provide and update, as necessary, a comprehensive list of all of the subsidiaries and affiliates on

                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The statute does not give the Secretary of Defense the mission to maintain such a list.

                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The term &ldquo;defense&rdquo; is used in the term &ldquo;covered defense telecommunications equipment or services&rdquo; to clarify that the covered telecommunications equipment or services prohibited by section 1656 are only prohibited for DoD, therefore, a definition is not necessary.

                <p id="p-26" data-page="3833">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     To ensure consistency in the event of future changes to the list, the technologies are referenced by a citation, within the definition, to section 1758 of the Export Control Reform Act of 2018.

                     The prescription is not limited to covered missions as a matter of national security. Covered missions include the examples provided in the statutory definition. The statute does not provide additional examples of covered missions.

                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The waiver process is an internal Government operating procedure. By submission of an offer containing the prohibited equipment or services, an entity is by default requesting a waiver. Waivers are a limited exception to the prohibition, and questions regarding the waiver process may be directed to the contracting officer. The contracting officer, working with the requiring activity, will review the representations and disclosures and make a determination to process the formal waiver. At that time, a contracting officer will request the additional information required by the statute for processing a waiver; this does not preclude an offeror from providing this information with its offer.

                    <em>Response:</em>
                     DIBNet provides information on its website to clarify who has access to the data. The data is shared with the contracting officer so the contracting officer may work with legal counsel to enforce contractual remedies for violating the terms of the contract.

                     The text of the rule aligns with the statutory language. This term is not defined in the statute. The FAR and DFARS rules on the section 889 prohibition are intended to be complementary.

It is important to apply the statutory prohibitions to all acquisitions in order to protect the security of nuclear command, control, and communications systems and ballistic missile defense from commercial dependencies on equipment and services from certain companies or certain foreign countries that are considered to create a risk to our national security.</p>

                    This final rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>, 
                    <em>et seq.</em>
                     A final regulatory flexibility analysis has been performed and is summarized as follows:
                </p>
                <p id="p-49" data-page="3834">DoD is converting to a final rule, with two minor changes, an interim rule that amended the DFARS to implement section 1656 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2018. This rule also partially implements section 889(a)(1)(A) of the NDAA for FY 2019 prohibitions for DoD, and is structured to align with the Federal Acquisition Regulation implementation of the section 889(a)(1)(A) Governmentwide prohibition. The changes to the interim rule do not change the economic impact on the public. The changes provide additional time to complete the reporting requirements required by the clause at DFARS 252.204-7018, Prohibition on the Acquisition of Covered Defense Telecommunications Equipment or Services.</p>
                <p id="p-50" data-page="3834">The objective of this rule is to increase security of systems and critical technology which is part of any system used to carry out the nuclear deterrence and homeland defense missions of DoD by prohibiting the use of telecommunications equipment or services from certain Chinese entities, and from any other entities that the Secretary of Defense reasonably believes to be owned or controlled by or otherwise connected to, the government of the People's Republic of China or the Russian Federation. Section 1656 of the NDAA for FY 2018 and section 889(a)(1)(A) of the NDAA for FY 2019 are the legal basis for the rule.</p>
                <p id="p-51" data-page="3834">There were no public comments in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis.</p>
                <p id="p-52" data-page="3834">This rule includes a burden for two representations and a reporting requirement. Data from the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 through FY 2018 and data from the System for Award Management (SAM) was used to estimate the number of small businesses affected by this rule.</p>
                <p id="p-53" data-page="3834">The provision at DFARS 252.204-7016, Covered Defense Telecommunications Equipment or Services&mdash;Representation, requires the offeror to represent whether it does or does not provide covered defense telecommunications equipment or services as a part of its offered products or services to the Government in the performance of any contract, subcontract, or other contractual instrument. This provision is estimated to affect 145,955 unique small businesses, which is the estimated number of unique small businesses required to complete DoD representations in SAM.</p>
                <p id="p-54" data-page="3834">
                    As of July 15, 2019, there were 424,927 active registrants in SAM for contracts. DoD extrapolated the estimated number of SAM registrants that are required to fill out DoD

                    representations to be 211,529 unique entities by dividing the average number of DoD unique awardees in the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) by the average number of Federal unique awardees in FPDS for FY 2016 through FY 2018 to obtain a percentage of 49.78 percent of all Federal unique awardees that receive DoD awards. Applying 49.78 percent to the total number of active SAM registrants results in 211,529 estimated respondents. To further calculate the number of estimated respondents that are small businesses, this analysis multiplies the 211,529 estimated respondents for DoD by 69 percent, which is the percentage of unique DoD awardees on average for FY 2016 through FY 2018 in FPDS that are small businesses, to estimate 145,955 unique small entities impacted by DFARS 252.204-7016.
                </p>
                <p id="p-55" data-page="3835">The provision at DFARS 252.204-7017, Prohibition on Acquisition of Covered Defense Telecommunications Equipment or Services&mdash;Representation, requires that if an offeror provides an affirmative representation under the provision at 252.204-7016, Covered Defense Telecommunications Equipment or Services&mdash;Representation, that offeror is required to represent whether it will or will not provide under the contract, covered defense telecommunications equipment or services. If the offeror responds affirmatively, the offeror is required to further disclose information about the covered defense telecommunications equipment or services.</p>
                <p id="p-56" data-page="3835">DFARS provision 252.204-7017 is estimated to affect a total of only 3,054 unique small business entities. Although DoD has no factual basis on which to estimate at this time what percentage of offerors will respond affirmatively to this representation, to be conservative DoD estimates 10 percent of the 44,277 DoD unique awardees on average in FPDS for FY 2016 through FY 2018 (4,428) will respond affirmatively, which triggers the disclosure requirement of the representation. Applying the estimated 69 percent factor for small businesses to the estimate of 4,428 results in 3,054. To calculate the additional disclosure impact within 252.204-7017, DoD estimates 10 percent of the offerors filling out this representation will have to complete the additional disclosure (443 total, of which 306 are small entities).</p>
                <p id="p-57" data-page="3835">
                    The clause at DFARS 252.204-7018, Prohibition on the Acquisition of Covered Defense Telecommunications Equipment or Services, requires contractors and subcontractors to report through 
                    <em><a href="https://dibnet.dod.mil" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://dibnet.dod.mil</a>,</em>
                     any discovery of covered telecommunications equipment or services during the course of contract performance. Although DoD has no factual basis on which to estimate at this time what percentage of awardees will be required to submit a report, the clause is estimated to affect 443 unique entities, which is 1 percent of the number of unique entities that received DoD awards on average for FY 2016 through FY 2018 in FPDS (44,277). Of the 443 impacted entities 306 entities (69 percent) are estimated to be DoD unique small entities.
                </p>
                <p id="p-58" data-page="3835">Because of the nature of the prohibition enacted by section 1656, it is not possible to establish different compliance or reporting requirements or timetables that take into account the resources available to small entities or to exempt small entities from coverage of the rule, or any part thereof. DoD was unable to identify any alternatives that would reduce the burden on small entities and still meet the objectives of section 1656.</p>
