                <h2 id="h-7">I. Background</h2>
                <p id="p-7" data-page="65559">
                    DoD is amending the DFARS to implement section 816 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2019. Section 816 amends <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2304a" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2304a(d)(3)(A)</a> by modifying the limitations on single-source task or delivery order contracts. Currently, FAR 16.504(c)(1)(ii)(D)(
                    <em>1</em>)(
                    <em>i</em>) prohibits the award of a task or delivery order contract in an amount exceeding $112 million to a single source unless the head of the agency determines that the orders expected under the contract are so integrally related that only a single source can reasonably perform the work. Section 816 amends this limitation in <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2304a" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2304a</a> to require the head of the agency to determine that only a single source can &ldquo;efficiently perform the work,&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;reasonably perform the work&rdquo; as required by <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/4103" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 4103</a>. This rule adds text to DFARS 216.504 to require agency heads to make the determination required by section 816, in lieu of the determination at FAR 16.504(c)(1)(ii)(D)(
                    <em>1</em>)(
                    <em>i</em>). In addition, editorial changes are made in DFARS 215.504(c) to add paragraph headings and renumber subparagraphs to align with the FAR.
                </p>
                <h2 id="h-8">II. Applicability to Contracts at or Below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold and for Commercial Items, Including Commercially Available Off-the-Shelf Items</h2>
                <p id="p-8" data-page="65559">This rule does not create any new provisions or clauses or impact any existing provisions or clauses.</p>
                <h2 id="h-9">III. Publication of This Final Rule for Public Comment Is Not Required by Statute</h2>
                <p id="p-9" data-page="65559">The statute that applies to the publication of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) is Office of Federal Procurement Policy statute (codified at title 41 of the United States Code). Specifically, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1707" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1707(a)(1)</a> requires that a procurement policy, regulation, procedure or form (including an amendment or modification thereof) must be published for public comment if it relates to the expenditure of appropriated funds, and has either a significant effect beyond the internal operating procedures of the agency issuing the policy, regulation, procedure, or form, or has a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors. This final rule is not required to be published for public comment, because it only impacts determination and documentation processes that are internal to the agency.</p>
                <h2 id="h-10">IV. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563</h2>
                <p id="p-10" data-page="65559">
                    Executive Order (E.O.) 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review; and <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a>, Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review, direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. The Office of Management and Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, has determined that this is not a significant regulatory action as defined under section 3(f) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a> and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b). This rule is not a major rule as defined at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/804" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 804(2)</a>.
