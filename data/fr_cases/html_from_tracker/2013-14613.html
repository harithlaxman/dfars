                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         Suggest that this coverage be moved to a new section within FAR subpart 17.5 (
                        <em>e.g.,</em>
                         FAR 17.505). This way, the rule would be where readers would reasonably expect it to be and they would not have to move back and forth between subparts, which are typically located on different Web pages.

                        <em>Response:</em>
                         To simplify locating the required regulations, a cross reference to FAR subpart 17.7 is included at FAR 17.500 and another cross reference to FAR subpart 17.5 is included at FAR 17.700.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         FAR 17.703(b)(2) does not mention DoD class deviations to the FAR and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS). If nondefense agencies will be required to comply with DoD class deviations, it is suggested that this be explicitly stated along with a Web address where they can be found.

                         The rule was amended to reference DoD class deviations and the Web address where they can be found.

                    <p id="p-19" data-page="37685">
                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         The commenter knew what a contracting officer is, but wondered what a DoD &ldquo;acquisition official&rdquo; other than a contracting officer might be. The commenter added that &ldquo;all approvals should be routed through the office of the contracting division that would otherwise write the contract.&rdquo;
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-20" data-page="37685">
                        <em>Response:</em>
                         The term &ldquo;Department of Defense (DoD) acquisition official&rdquo; is defined in FAR 17.701, consistent with statute, and is used throughout FAR subpart 17.7. Specific guidance regarding designation of agency acquisition officials, their delegated authority, and routing of contractual documents is more suitable for inclusion in agency regulations rather than the FAR.

                    <p id="p-21" data-page="37685">
                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         The commenter sees no benefit in adhering to an &ldquo;annual&rdquo; fiscal year self-certification requirement that ensures a nondefense agency is compliant with defense procurement requirements. The commenter recommends, as a means of eliminating non-value-added paperwork for all parties and procurement delays, that DoD seek approval to change the nondefense agency self-certification requirement from &ldquo;each fiscal year&rdquo; to &ldquo;every five years.&rdquo;
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-22" data-page="37685">
                        <em>Response:</em>
                         The annual certification requirement for nondefense agencies that acquire supplies and services on behalf of DoD included in FAR subpart 17.7 is prescribed by law. The suggestion submitted by the commenter requires a statutory change that is beyond the scope of this FAR case.

                            However, this rule also amends the FAR to include a clarification at 4.603(c), restating existing Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) and Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) policy regarding the allocation of socio-economic credit for assisted acquisitions, 
                            <em>i.e.,</em>
                             &ldquo;for assisted acquisitions, the requesting agency will receive socio-economic credit for meeting small business goals, where applicable.&rdquo;

                        <p id="p-27" data-page="37685">Although we do not expect the clarification to have a direct economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, there is the possibility that the regulatory clarification may improve the accuracy of FPDS data submissions allocating socio-economic credit to agencies for contracts and orders awarded to a substantial number of small entities. Improved data accuracy can have a positive impact on agencies' annual small business goals.</p>
