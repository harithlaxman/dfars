                    DoD published a proposed rule in the

L. 114-328</a>), which requires that competition on DoD contracts not be limited through the use of brand name or equal descriptions, or proprietary specifications or standards, in solicitations, unless a justification for such specification is provided and approved in accordance with <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2304" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2304(f)</a>.

                <p id="p-11" data-page="25190">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     A respondent expressed concern that subjecting brand name or equal descriptions to the justification and approval process will discourage the use of solicitations that signal a preference for, but do not require, a specific brand or product.

                <p id="p-12" data-page="25190">
                    <em>Response:</em>

                <p id="p-13" data-page="25191">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     Several respondents advised that requiring brand name or proprietary equipment typically assures that a certain level of quality and warranty will be conveyed with the item. The respondents expressed concern that DoD may face difficulties ensuring that equivalent products provide the same level of quality assurance as brand name or proprietary equipment during the product's lifecycle. Further, one respondent expressed dissatisfaction with placing additional restrictions on the ability to use brand name descriptions when procuring complex system components, as the action prevents DoD from making the best decisions about the quality of goods being used in the national defense.
                </p>
                <p id="p-14" data-page="25191">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The rule does not prohibit the use of brand name descriptions, brand name or equal descriptions, or proprietary specifications and standards, when necessary. Instead, the rule encourages the development of requirement descriptions that enable competition, to the maximum extent possible. For example, if a system component to be used in national defense requires a minimum level of quality and reliability, those physical, functional, and performance needs can be expressed in the description of the requirement and a competitive solicitation may be issued. If the component requirements for quality and reliability can only be expressed in terms of or met by a single brand name description, proprietary specifications or standards, or a brand name or equal description, then the description or specifications and standards may be used in the acquisition; but, only after the action is justified with sufficient facts and rationale and approved in accordance with FAR 6.3 and DFARS 206.3.

                <p id="p-15" data-page="25191">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     To mitigate life-cycle quality assurance concerns, one respondent suggested that solicitations utilizing brand name or equal descriptions include a comparable life-cycle length for the product, as necessary, to ensure DoD receives an equal product in terms of durability and warranty.

                <p id="p-16" data-page="25191">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     Requirements personnel determine and define the minimum physical, functional, and performance characteristics of a requirement necessary to ensure it will meet DoD's needs. At their discretion, requirements personnel can identify an essential life-cycle length or warranty coverage in the description of the requirement.

                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     Another respondent suggested that removing the draft proposed text at DFARS 206.302-1(c)(2)(S-70), regarding the use of proprietary specifications and standards, may help alleviate concerns about DoD receiving a necessary level of quality assurance.

                <p id="p-18" data-page="25191">

                <p id="p-19" data-page="25191">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     Some respondents advised that the rule is unclear whether the Government intends to apply the justification and approval requirement to acquisitions valued at or below the SAT.
                </p>
                <p id="p-20" data-page="25191">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The rule does not apply the justification and approval requirement to acquisitions valued at or below the SAT. The rule adds text to DFARS 206.3, Other Than Full and Open Competition, and DFARS 213.5, Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items, neither of which apply to acquisitions valued at or below the simplified acquisition threshold. The rule also adds text to DFARS subpart 211.1, Selecting and Developing Requirements Documents.
                </p>
                <p id="p-21" data-page="25191">In the proposed rule, the requirement to execute a justification and approval when using such descriptions or specifications and standards appeared as a standalone statement under DFARS 211.1, with two subparagraphs directing the contracting officer to see the proposed rule text in DFARS 206.3 and 213.5, as applicable. The rule uses the title of FAR 13.5, Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items, only to refer to the procedures for the acquisition of commercial supplies and services in an amount greater than the simplified acquisition threshold but not exceeding $7 million.</p>
                <p id="p-22" data-page="25191">The intent of the text in this subpart is to clarify that a justification and approval is required to include brand name or equal descriptions, or proprietary specifications or standards, in DoD solicitations that use sealed bidding, or negotiated acquisition procedures, or simplified acquisition procedures for certain commercial items, as specified in the following two subparagraphs. To clarify the intent of the rule, the text in subpart 211.1 has been changed from a standalone statement to a statement that a justification and approval is required when using the procedures identified in the subsequent subparagraphs; and, to add a reference to &ldquo;FAR 13.5&rdquo; after simplified acquisition procedures for certain commercial items.</p>
                <h2 id="h-15">III. Applicability to Contracts at or Below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold and for Commercial Items, Including Commercially Available Off-the-Shelf Items</h2>

                <p id="p-24" data-page="25191">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility.

                </p>
                <p id="p-28" data-page="25192">The objective of this final rule is to ensure that a justification is executed and approved prior to including brand name or equal descriptions, or proprietary specifications or standards, in a solicitation that uses simplified procedures for certain commercial items or negotiated acquisition or sealed bidding procedures.</p>

                <p id="p-31" data-page="25192">FPDS can identify the number of offers received in response to a solicitation. This subset can help DoD better identify the number of competitive requirements that may have used such descriptions, specifications, or standards, but only received one offer for various reasons.</p>
                <p id="p-32" data-page="25192">As a result, FPDS identifies that there were 127,536 contracts and orders competed and awarded in FY 2017 that only received one offer. Of the 127,536 new awards, 76,179(60%) of these actions were awarded to 9,823 unique small business entities. The proposed rule applies to all entities who do business with the Federal Government and is not expected to have a significant impact on these entities, regardless of business size.</p>
