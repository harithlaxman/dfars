                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         The respondent took exception to changing the title of DFARS clause 252.227-7015 from &ldquo;Technical Data-Commercial Items&rdquo; to &ldquo;Technical Data-Commercial Products and Commercial Services&rdquo;. The respondent also took exception to changing &ldquo;commercial items&rdquo; to &ldquo;commercial products or commercial services&rdquo; within the text of the clause. While the respondent acknowledged that the existing DFARS clause 252.227-7015 applies to &ldquo;commercial items&rdquo;, the respondent stated that the current clause does not specifically define &ldquo;commercial item&rdquo;, nor does it reference the commercial item definition at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 2.101. The respondent also acknowledged that the prior FAR commercial item definition included services, but indicated that DFARS clause 252.227-7015 has not historically been applied to commercial services. The respondent also asserted that the clause has been applied consistent with DFARS 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data&mdash;Noncommercial Items, (
                        <em>i.e.,</em>
                         to technical data pertaining to items, components, or processes). The respondent asserted that this is an expansion of the coverage of DFARS 252.227-7015 to commercial services and is outside the scope of this rule. The respondent recommended that all references to commercial services in the title and text of the clause be removed.

                        <em>Response:</em>
                         This rule implements sections 836 and 837(b) of the NDAA for FY 2019, which bifurcated the definition of &ldquo;commercial item&rdquo; into &ldquo;commercial product&rdquo; and &ldquo;commercial service&rdquo; at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/103" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 103</a> and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/103a" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">103a</a> and at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2533a" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2533a</a> and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2533b" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2533b</a>, respectively. The NDAA for FY 2019 does not change the meaning of the terms &ldquo;items&rdquo; or &ldquo;services&rdquo;. The title and text of DFARS clause 252.227-7015, Technical Data-Commercial Items, included the term &ldquo;commercial items&rdquo;, which means it included commercial products and commercial services in accordance with the prior definition of &ldquo;commercial item&rdquo; at FAR 2.101. In addition, paragraph (a)(1) of the clause clarified that the term &ldquo;commercial item&rdquo; as used in the clause, excluded commercial computer software; however, it did not exclude commercial services. Furthermore, DFARS part 227 does not include a definition of &ldquo;commercial item&rdquo; because the definition at FAR 2.101 is utilized for this part in accordance with FAR part 2. Therefore, changing the term &ldquo;commercial items&rdquo; to &ldquo;commercial products and commercial services&rdquo; within the clause and title of DFARS clause 252.227-7015 does not change the application or coverage of the clause.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         The respondent took exception to the replacement of the term &ldquo;noncommercial items&rdquo; with &ldquo;other than commercial products or commercial services&rdquo; in the DFARS sections pertaining to data rights because the new verbiage is awkward and wordy.

                         DoD acknowledges the respondent's concern that the new verbiage is awkward and wordy. This rule amends the DFARS to conform with the FAR final rule for FAR case 2018-018, published on November 4, 2021, at <a href="/citation/86-FR-61017" class="fr-reference" data-reference="86 FR 61017">86 FR 61017</a>, which changed all instances of &ldquo;noncommercial items&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-commercial items&rdquo; to &ldquo;other than commercial products and commercial services&rdquo; or &ldquo;other than commercial products or commercial services&rdquo; as appropriate within the context of the FAR. This was an editorial change to utilize a single term consistently throughout the FAR to help the Government, contractors, and offerors understand the regulations. For the same reason, the terms used in the FAR are also used in agency supplements to the FAR, including the DFARS. Therefore, this rule makes the same conforming changes to the DFARS.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         The respondent took exception to the replacement of the term &ldquo;noncommercial items&rdquo; with &ldquo;other than commercial&rdquo; in the DFARS sections pertaining to data rights indicating that this change will drive significant costs into DoD contracts, due to the required data rights markings and legends that will require deliverable technical data to be re-marked. The respondent also indicated that this rule may impact pre-existing technical data marked with prior legends that the contractor may deliver in the future. The respondent indicated that the change in terminology may require contractors to modify internal procedures and guidance for the marking of deliverable data, and that some contractors have invested private funds to automate the application of existing DFARS prescribed legends. In addition, the respondent indicated that DoD customers will reject Contract Data Requirements Lists that include the

                        <em>Response:</em>
                         In accordance with FAR 1.108(d), this rule will be applied prospectively; therefore, data markings and legends on data to be delivered under an existing contract will not require re-marking, and the data would not be rejected for this reason. Moreover, the DFARS allows contractors to mark data with the appropriate restrictive legend for which the data qualified under a previous contract (
                        <em>e.g.,</em>
                         DFARS clause 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data&mdash;Noncommercial Items); therefore, this rule will not increase costs because it does not require re-marking of pre-existing data that includes authorized pre-existing markings. Lastly, these changes do not impose additional information collection requirements to the paperwork burden previously approved under OMB Control Number 0704-0369, titled: DFARS Subpart 227.71, Rights in Technical Data, and Subpart 227.72, Rights in Computer Software and Computer Software Documentation, and related provisions and clauses.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         The respondent recommended removing the coverage for &ldquo;services&rdquo; at DFARS part 227 due to the inapplicability of the &ldquo;follow the funds&rdquo; test to services. The respondent also indicated that the funding test in DFARS 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data-Noncommercial Items, applies to items, components, or processes to which the technical data pertains, not to services.

                        <em>Response:</em>
                         This rule implements sections 836 and 837(b) of the NDAA for FY 2019, which bifurcated the definition of &ldquo;commercial item&rdquo; into &ldquo;commercial product&rdquo; and &ldquo;commercial service&rdquo; at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/103" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 103</a> and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/103a" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">103a</a> and at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2533a" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2533a</a> and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2533b" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2533b</a>, respectively. This rule does not change the meaning of the terms &ldquo;items&rdquo; or &ldquo;services&rdquo;, nor does it change the application of the funding test; therefore, this is outside the scope of this rule.

                    <p id="p-18" data-page="6579">The definition of &ldquo;Technical information&rdquo; at DFARS 204.7301, 252.204-7009, and 252.204-7012 is amended to remove the phrase &ldquo;regardless of whether or not the clause is incorporated in this solicitation or contract&rdquo;. DFARS 211.274-2(b)(2) is amended to delete &ldquo;or commercial service&rdquo; that was erroneously included in the proposed rule as services cannot be marked with an item unique identifier. DFARS 212.102(a)(i)(B) and (iii) are amended to replace &ldquo;commercial item&rdquo; with &ldquo;commercial product or commercial service&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;or&rdquo; is changed to &ldquo;and&rdquo; at DFARS 212.202 for consistency throughout the DFARS. DFARS 212.504(a) and (b) are amended to add &ldquo;or commercial components&rdquo; which was erroneously deleted in the proposed rule. DFARS 215.404-71-5(b)(7) is amended to add &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; prior to &ldquo;processes&rdquo; for consistency throughout the DFARS. DFARS 225.7503(a) and (b), 227.7102, 252.203-7001(g), and 252.227-7018(k) are amended to replace &ldquo;including commercial components&rdquo; with &ldquo;commercial components&rdquo; or with &ldquo;or commercial components&rdquo; for accuracy and consistency throughout the DFARS. DFARS 234.7002 is amended to remove &ldquo;and commercial services&rdquo; as a major weapon system in part 234 is a product. DFARS 234.7002(d)(5) is amended to change &ldquo;item&rdquo; to &ldquo;commercial product&rdquo; to align with the text of the paragraph. The title of DFARS subpart 244.4 is amended to restore &ldquo;and commercial components&rdquo; for accuracy and consistency throughout the DFARS. DFARS 225.215-7010(b)(ii) and (b)(ii)(A) are amended to add &ldquo;or commercial service&rdquo; throughout to align with the title of paragraph 225.215-7010(b)(ii). DFARS 252.215-7013 is amended to correct the reference for the definition of nontraditional defense contractor. DFARS 252.227-7015 is amended by modifying the definition at (a)(1), deleting (a)(4), and renumbering (a)(5) to (a)(4) to align with the revised clause title.</p>

                    <p id="p-19" data-page="6579">This rule does not create any new solicitation provisions or contract clauses. It does not impact any existing solicitation provisions, contract clauses, or prescriptions for provisions or clauses or their applicability to contracts valued at or below the simplified acquisition threshold, for commercial products including COTS items, or for commercial services.</p>
                    <h2 id="h-15">IV. Expected Impact of the Rule</h2>
                    <p id="p-20" data-page="6579">This final rule does not create new requirements or modify any existing requirements. This final rule merely replaces the term &ldquo;commercial item&rdquo; with &ldquo;commercial product,&rdquo; &ldquo;commercial service,&rdquo; &ldquo;commercial product or commercial service,&rdquo; or &ldquo;commercial product and commercial service&rdquo;. In addition, this final rule replaces all instances of &ldquo;noncommercial item&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-commercial item&rdquo; with &ldquo;other than commercial product and commercial service&rdquo; or &ldquo;other than commercial product or commercial service&rdquo; as appropriate within the context of DFARS text, including existing solicitation provisions and contract clauses. These revisions do not modify commercial acquisition procedures, nor do they modify Government or industry operations. This final rule is expected to be beneficial to Government and industry, as it resolves an issue the Section 809 Panel cited, which is the inconsistent interpretation of policy and confusion over how to identify eligible commercial products and commercial services. Bifurcating the definition of &ldquo;commercial item&rdquo; into &ldquo;commercial product&rdquo; and &ldquo;commercial service&rdquo; is a way to provide clarity for the acquisition workforce, which may result in greater engagement with the commercial marketplace. Therefore, this final rule is expected to be beneficial to Government and industry.</p>

                    <p id="p-23" data-page="6580">
                        A final regulatory flexibility (FRFA) analysis has been prepared consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>, 
                        <em>et seq.</em>
                         The FRFA is summarized as follows:
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-24" data-page="6580">This final rule is necessary to implement sections 836, 837(b), and 837(c) of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/115/public/232" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 115-232</a>). Section 836 replaces the definition of &ldquo;commercial item&rdquo; at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/103" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 103</a> with &ldquo;commercial product&rdquo; at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/103" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 103</a> and a definition of &ldquo;commercial service&rdquo; at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/103a" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 103a</a>. Section 837(b) and (c) implement this revision at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2533a" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2533a</a> and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2533b" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2533b</a>. In addition, this rule replaces all instances of &ldquo;noncommercial item&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-commercial item&rdquo; with &ldquo;other than commercial product and commercial service&rdquo; or &ldquo;other than commercial product or commercial service&rdquo;, as appropriate within the context of the DFARS text. The objective of this proposed rule is to implement sections 836, 837(b), and 837(c) of the John S. McCain NDAA for FY 2019 to align the text of the DFARS with the new statutory definitions of commercial product and commercial service.</p>
                    <p id="p-25" data-page="6580">No significant issues were raised by the public comments received in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis; therefore, no changes were made to the proposed rule as a result of public comments.</p>
                    <p id="p-26" data-page="6580">This final rule will apply to all entities that do business with DoD, including the 355,208 small business entities in the System for Award Management. However, DoD does not expect this rule to have a significant economic impact because the rule does not contain any requirements with which small entities must comply. This rule provides clarity for the acquisition workforce by replacing all instances of &ldquo;commercial item&rdquo; with &ldquo;commercial product&rdquo; and/or &ldquo;commercial service&rdquo;, as appropriate within the context of the DFARS text.</p>
                    <p id="p-27" data-page="6580">This final rule does not include any new reporting, recordkeeping, or other compliance requirements for small businesses.</p>
                    <p id="p-28" data-page="6580">DoD did not identify any significant alternatives that would minimize or reduce the significant economic impact on small entities, because there is no significant impact on small entities.</p>
                    <h2 id="h-19">VIII. Paperwork Reduction Act</h2>
                    <p id="p-29" data-page="6580">The Paperwork Reduction Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/44/3501" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44 U.S.C. chapter 35</a>) applies to this rule. However, these changes to the DFARS do not impose additional information collection requirements to the paperwork burden previously approved under OMB Control Number 0704-0369, entitled: DFARS Subpart 227.71, Rights in Technical Data, and Subpart 227.72, Rights in Computer Software and Computer Software Documentation, and related provisions and clauses.</p>

Contracting officers shall presume that a commercial product or commercial service was developed exclusively at private expense whether or not a contractor or subcontractor submits a justification in response to a challenge notice. The contracting officer shall not challenge a contractor's assertion that a commercial product or commercial service was developed exclusively at private expense unless the Government can specifically state the reasonable grounds to question the validity of the assertion. The challenge notice shall include sufficient information to reasonably demonstrate that the commercial product or commercial service was not developed exclusively at private expense. In order to sustain the challenge, the contracting officer shall provide information demonstrating that the commercial product or commercial service was not developed exclusively at private expense. The challenge notice and all related correspondence shall be subject to handling procedures for classified information and controlled unclassified information. A contractor's or subcontractor's failure to respond to the challenge notice cannot be the sole basis for issuing a final decision denying the validity of an asserted restriction.
