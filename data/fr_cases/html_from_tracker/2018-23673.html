                    DoD published a proposed rule in the 
                    <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                     at <a href="/citation/83-FR-19677" class="fr-reference" data-reference="83 FR 19677">83 FR 19677</a> on May 4, 2018, to implement section 1823 and paragraph (b) of section 1813 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2017. Sections 1823 and 1813 provide modifications to the DoD Pilot Mentor-Prot&eacute;g&eacute; Program (&ldquo;the Program&rdquo;). Section 1823 revises the definition and

                    requirements associated with affiliation between mentor firms and their prot&eacute;g&eacute; firms. Both sections add new types of assistance for mentor firms to provide to their prot&eacute;g&eacute; firms.

                <h2 id="h-8">II. Discussion and Analysis</h2>
                <p id="p-8" data-page="54678">One respondent submitted a public comment in response to the proposed rule. DoD reviewed the public comment in the development of the final rule.</p>
                <h3 id="h-9">A. Summary of Significant Changes From the Proposed Rule</h3>
                <p id="p-9" data-page="54678">There are no changes made to the final rule as a result of the public comment.</p>
                <h3 id="h-10">B. Analysis of Public Comments</h3>
                <p id="p-10" data-page="54678">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     The respondent recommended a change to the proposed text in Appendix I, section I-107, paragraph (h). Specifically, the respondent proposed limiting the assistance to be provided by the mentor firm regarding Federal contract regulations to &ldquo;guidance in obtaining training to enable understanding Federal contract regulations&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;assistance the mentor will provide to the prot&eacute;g&eacute; firm in understanding Federal contract regulations&rdquo; as stated in the proposed rule. The rationale was that the text in the proposed rule could potentially expose the mentor firm to liability when inevitable misunderstandings occur due to the complexity of the regulations.
                </p>
                <p id="p-11" data-page="54678">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     In drafting the text of I-107 paragraph (h), DoD used language that was very close to the text of section 1813 of the NDAA for FY 2017. The statutory language and, consequently, the draft DFARS text add to the mentor-prot&eacute;g&eacute; agreement an element in which the mentor will identify the assistance it will provide to the prot&eacute;g&eacute; in an effort to facilitate the prot&eacute;g&eacute;'s understanding of Federal contract regulations. Such assistance could include guidance in obtaining training on the regulations, but it also could include other forms of assistance.
                </p>
                <h3 id="h-11">C. Other Changes</h3>
                <p id="p-12" data-page="54678">The final rule includes a minor editorial change. In section I-111, paragraph (e) is revised to update the reference to renumbered paragraphs in I-107.</p>

                <p id="p-14" data-page="54678">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993.

                    A final regulatory flexibility analysis (FRFA) has been prepared consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>, 
                    <em>et seq.</em>
                     The FRFA is summarized as follows:

                <p id="p-17" data-page="54678">This final rule is necessary to implement statutory modifications to the DoD Pilot Mentor-Prot&eacute;g&eacute; Program (&ldquo;the Program&rdquo;). This rule amends the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) to implement section 1823 and paragraph (b) of section 1813 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2017, which provide modifications to the Program. Specifically, section 1823 revises the definition and requirements associated with affiliation between mentor firms and their prot&eacute;g&eacute; firms. Both sections add new types of assistance for mentors to provide to their prot&eacute;g&eacute;s.</p>
                <p id="p-18" data-page="54678">There were no issues raised by the public in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis provided in the proposed rule.</p>
                <p id="p-19" data-page="54678">The rule will apply to small entities that participate in the Program. There are currently 72 small entities participating in the Program as prot&eacute;g&eacute; firms and six small entities participating as mentors.</p>
                <p id="p-20" data-page="54678">The rule does not impose any reporting or recordkeeping requirements on any small entities.</p>
                <p id="p-21" data-page="54678">DoD has not identified any alternatives that would meet the requirements of the applicable statute.</p>
