                <p id="p-6" data-page="33171"></p>
                <h2 id="h-7">I. Background</h2>
                <p id="p-7" data-page="33171">This final rule amends the DoD pilot program addressed in Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) Subpart 212.70, Pilot Program for Transition to Follow-On Contracting after Use of Other Transaction Authority (OTA). It adds a new section 212.7002-3, Thresholds, to clarify that, consistent with FAR 1.108(c), Dollar Thresholds, the threshold limitation for contracts and subcontracts under the pilot program of $50 million includes the dollar value of all options.</p>
                <p id="p-8" data-page="33171">DoD has issued this rule as a final rule because the rule does not have a significant effect beyond DoD internal operating procedures as it merely reinforces current guidance in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). Further, it does not have a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors. FAR 1.108(c) currently states, in part, that &ldquo;unless otherwise specified, a specific dollar threshold for the purpose of applicability is the final anticipated dollar value of the action, including the dollar value of all options.&rdquo;</p>
                <h2 id="h-8">II. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563</h2>
                <p id="p-9" data-page="33171">Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">Executive Order 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under Section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">Executive Order 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993. This rule is not a major rule under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/804" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 804</a>.</p>
                <h2 id="h-9">III. Regulatory Flexibility Act</h2>
                <p id="p-10" data-page="33171">The Regulatory Flexibility Act does not apply to this rule. This final rule does not constitute a significant DFARS revision within the meaning of FAR 1.501 and public comment is not required in accordance with <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1707" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1707</a>.</p>
                <h2 id="h-10">IV. Paperwork Reduction Act</h2>
                <p id="p-11" data-page="33171">The rule does not impose any information collection requirements that require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/44/3501" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44 U.S.C. chapter 35</a>).</p>
