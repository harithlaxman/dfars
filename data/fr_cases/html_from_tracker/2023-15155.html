                    <h2 id="h-7">I. Background</h2>
                    <p id="p-7" data-page="46906">DoD is amending the DFARS to implement section 851 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/117/public/263" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 117-263</a>), which adds New Zealand to the definition of the national technology and industrial base at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/4801" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 4801</a>. The definition already includes the United States, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Australia, and Canada as the countries within which the activities of the national technology and industrial base are conducted. <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/4864" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 4864</a>, Miscellaneous Limitations on the Procurement of Goods Other Than United States Goods, requires that DoD only procure certain items if the manufacturer of the items is part of the national technology and industrial base.</p>
                    <p id="p-8" data-page="46906">This final rule modifies several sections in DFARS subpart 225.70, which implement the restrictions of <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/4864" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 4864</a>, to add New Zealand to the list of countries from which certain items may be purchased. The rule also adds New Zealand to the countries listed in the solicitation provision at DFARS 252.225-7037, Evaluation of Offers for Air Circuit Breakers, and the contract clause at DFARS 252.225-7038, Restriction on Acquisition of Air Circuit Breakers.</p>
                    <h2 id="h-8">II. Publication of This Final Rule for Public Comment Is Not Required by Statute</h2>
                    <p id="p-9" data-page="46906">The statute that applies to the publication of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) is <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1707" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1707</a>, Publication of Proposed Regulations. Subsection (a)(1) of the statute requires that a procurement policy, regulation, procedure, or form (including an amendment or modification thereof) must be published for public comment if it relates to the expenditure of appropriated funds and has either a significant effect beyond the internal operating procedures of the agency issuing the policy, regulation, procedure, or form, or has a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors. This final rule is not required to be published for public comment, because this rule implements the section 851 changes to <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/4801" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 4801(1)</a> by merely adding New Zealand to the list of countries that includes the United States, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Australia, and Canada as the countries within which the activities of the national technology and industrial base are conducted. This change does not have a significant effect beyond the internal operating procedures of the Government and does not have a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors.</p>
                    <h2 id="h-9">III. Applicability to Contracts at or Below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT), for Commercial Products, Including Commercially Available Off-the-Shelf (COTS) Items, and for Commercial Services</h2>
                    <p id="p-10" data-page="46906">This final rule modifies one existing solicitation provision (DFARS 252.225-7037) and one existing contract clause (DFARS 252.225-7038), which relate to implementation of the limitations of <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/4864" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 4864</a> with regard to acquisition of air circuit breakers. This rule does not implement any new requirements, but adds New Zealand as a country from which items restricted by <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/4864" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 4864</a> may be purchased. It does not modify the applicability of the provision and clause to the acquisition of commercial services, and commercial products, including COTS items.</p>
                    <h2 id="h-10">IV. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563</h2>
                    <p id="p-11" data-page="46906">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993.</p>
                    <h2 id="h-11">V. Congressional Review Act</h2>
                    <p id="p-12" data-page="46906">
                        As required by the Congressional Review Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/801" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 801-808</a>) before an interim or final rule takes effect, DoD will submit a copy of the interim or final rule with the form, Submission of Federal Rules under the Congressional Review Act, to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Comptroller General of the United States. A major rule under the Congressional Review Act cannot take effect until 60 days after it is published in the 
                        <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                        . The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has determined that this rule is not a major rule as defined by <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/804" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 804</a>.
                    </p>
                    <h2 id="h-12">VI. Regulatory Flexibility Act</h2>
                    <p id="p-13" data-page="46906">The Regulatory Flexibility Act does not apply to this rule because this final rule does not constitute a significant DFARS revision within the meaning of FAR 1.501-1, and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1707" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1707</a> does not require publication for public comment.</p>
                    <h2 id="h-13">VII. Paperwork Reduction Act</h2>
                    <p id="p-14" data-page="46906">The rule does not contain any information collection requirements that require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/44/3501" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44 U.S.C. chapter 35</a>).</p>
