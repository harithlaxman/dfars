                <h1 id="h-6">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</h1>
                <h2 id="h-7">I. Background</h2>
                <p id="p-6" data-page="17446">Section 866 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2011 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/111/public/383" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 111-383</a>), enacted on January 7, 2011, authorized the Secretary of Defense to carry out a pilot program to assess the feasibility and advisability of acquiring military-purpose nondevelopmental items in accordance with the streamlined procedures of the pilot program. Under this pilot program, DoD may enter into contracts with nontraditional defense contractors for the purpose of enabling DoD to acquire items that otherwise might not have been available to DoD, assist DoD in the rapid acquisition and fielding of capabilities needed to meet urgent operational needs, and protect the interests of the United States in paying fair and reasonable prices for the item or items acquired.</p>
                <p id="p-7" data-page="17446">This pilot program is designed to test whether the streamlined procedures, similar to those available for commercial items, can serve as an effective incentive for nontraditional defense contractors to (1) channel investment and innovation into areas that are useful to DoD and (2) provide items developed exclusively at private expense to meet validated military requirements.</p>
                <p id="p-8" data-page="17446">This final rule amends DFARS subpart 212.71, Pilot Program for Acquisition of Military-Purpose Nondevelopmental Items, to implement section 814, Extension of Pilot Program of Military Purpose Nondevelomental Items, of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2014. This rule extends the authority for this pilot program from January 6, 2016, to December 31, 2019.</p>
                <h2 id="h-8">II. Publication of This Final Rule for Public Comment Is Not Required by Statute</h2>
                <p id="p-9" data-page="17446">&ldquo;Publication of proposed regulations&rdquo;, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1707" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1707</a>, is the statute that applies to the publication of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Paragraph (a)(1) of the statute requires that a procurement policy, regulation, procedure or form (including an amendment or modification thereof) must be published for public comment if it relates to the expenditure of appropriated funds, and has either a significant effect beyond the internal operating procedures of the agency issuing the policy, regulation, procedure or form, or has a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors. Publication for public comment is not required because the rule does not have a significant effect beyond the internal operating procedures of DoD and does not have a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors as it merely extends the expiration date of an existing pilot program pursuant to statutory directive.</p>
                <h2 id="h-9">III. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563</h2>
                <p id="p-10" data-page="17446">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993. This rule is not a major rule under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/804" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 804</a>.</p>
                <h2 id="h-10">IV. Regulatory Flexibility Act</h2>
                <p id="p-11" data-page="17446">
                    The Regulatory Flexibility Act does not apply to this rule because this final rule does not constitute a significant DFARS revision within the meaning of FAR 1.501-1, and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1707" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1707</a> and does not require publication for public comment.
