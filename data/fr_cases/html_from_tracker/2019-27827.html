Approximately 81 percent received awards made pursuant to an agreement such as a Status of Forces Agreement.</p>

                         humanitarian and civic assistance), which is very different from the &ldquo;humanitarian or peacekeeping&rdquo; operation defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 2.101 and used in the DFARS. FPDS does collect data on humanitarian or peacekeeping operations, as defined in FAR 2.101. FPDS shows that about 1 percent of the small entities performing contracts or orders outside the United States received awards for humanitarian or peacekeeping operations. The data collected may provide some indication of the number of small entities that could perform contracts or orders for the type of humanitarian operation identified in section 1811.
