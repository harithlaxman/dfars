                    <p id="p-7" data-page="3682">
                        FAR subpart 28.2 requires agencies to obtain adequate security for bonds when bonds are used with a contract. A corporate or individual surety is an acceptable form of security for a bond. Corporate sureties are vetted by the Department of the Treasury to ensure

                        they are sufficiently capitalized and are listed on Department of the Treasury's Listing of Approved Sureties (Treasury Department Circular 570). Individual sureties are not listed on Treasury Department Circular 570; currently contracting officers determine if an individual surety is acceptable.

                    <p id="p-8" data-page="3683">
                        Under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/31/9310" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">31 U.S.C. 9310</a>, when Federal law permits acceptance of a surety bond from a surety not subject to <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/31/9305" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">31 U.S.C. 9305</a> and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/31/9306" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">9306</a> (
                        <em>i.e.,</em>
                         an individual surety that is not a corporate surety), the individual surety must pledge assets that are eligible obligations. Eligible obligations are public debt obligations of the United States Government whose principal and interest are unconditionally guaranteed by the United States Government. The requirements of <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/31/9310" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">31 U.S.C. 9310</a> are intended to strengthen the assets pledged by individual sureties, thereby mitigating risk to the Government.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-9" data-page="3683">This rule requires individual sureties to support their bond obligations with stable U.S.-backed securities as specified in <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-31/part-225" class="cfr external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">31 CFR part 225</a> and requires the Department of the Treasury, Bureau of the Fiscal Service to review those assets to ensure they meet established eligibility requirements. This rule is expected to provide some benefit to subcontractors (adequate security in case of default), and contracting officers (easier to determine value of assets pledged), to the extent that individual surety bonds are used, but there was some concern as to whether small businesses would have a more difficult time obtaining surety bonds if fewer individual sureties were providing bonds. DoD, GSA, and NASA requested public input, specifically from subcontractors, prime contractors, and individual sureties to more fully understand the impact of this regulation on affected parties. Individual sureties and prime contractors (including small businesses) did not provide input and did not indicate any concerns with the rule. One respondent representing subcontractors and suppliers in the construction industry had positive comments about the rule (see section II.B.1. of this preamble), confirming the anticipated benefits. Several respondents expressed the view that the rule will not negatively impact the availability of bonding for small construction businesses, noting the bonding assistance of the Small Business Administration and that the standard surety market has significantly expanded in recent years, providing many and varied avenues for small businesses to obtain bonding.</p>
                    <p id="p-10" data-page="3683">Therefore, based on public comments received, DoD, GSA, and NASA have concluded that the initial assessment is correct that there is very limited use of individual sureties on Federal construction contracts and the impact of this rule is not significant, and any impact is predominantly positive.</p>
                    <p id="p-11" data-page="3683">Six respondents submitted comments on the proposed rule.</p>

                    <p id="p-12" data-page="3683">The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council (the Councils) reviewed the public comments in the development of the final rule.</p>

                    <p id="p-13" data-page="3683">There are no significant changes made to the rule as a result of the public comments. One website reference has been corrected.</p>

                    <p id="p-14" data-page="3683">Of the six responses received, most strongly supported the rule, and none provided negative comments on the rule. One respondent noted a nonfunctioning link to a website, and one provided comments of a political nature that did not address the rule.</p>

                    <p id="p-27" data-page="3683">Although applicability of this rule to acquisitions below the SAT will be rare, DoD, GSA, and NASA do intend to apply the requirements of this rule to solicitations for contracts valued at or below the SAT. FAR 28.102-1(b) gives an example of when a bond could be required for an acquisition under the SAT. As noted in FAR 28.102-1(b), <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/40/3132" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">40 U.S.C. 3132</a> requires the contracting officer to select two or more payment protections for construction contracts greater than $35,000, but not greater than $150,000, one of the possible protections being a payment bond. Individual sureties may provide security for a payment bond in this situation. The FAR Council has determined that it is not in the best interest of the Government to waive the applicability of section 874 below the SAT, because the new requirement will create greater certainty of payment for subcontractors. Applying the rule below the SAT will continue the FAR uniformity in the type of assets allowed to be pledged, whether the acquisition is above or below the SAT.</p>
                    <p id="p-28" data-page="3683">Although applicability of this rule to acquisitions of commercial items will be rare, DoD, GSA, and NASA do intend to apply the requirements of this rule to solicitations for the acquisition of commercial items. FAR 28.103-1(a) states that &ldquo;Generally, agencies shall not require performance and payment bonds for other than construction contracts.&rdquo; However, performance and payment bonds may be used for other than construction contracts as permitted in FAR 28.103-2 and 28.103-3.</p>

                        of payment for subcontractors. Applying the rule to the acquisition of commercial items will continue the FAR uniformity in the type of assets allowed to be pledged, whether the acquisition is for the acquisition of commercial or other than commercial items.

                            This FAR rule changes the kinds of assets that individual sureties must pledge as security for their individual surety bonds. The objective of the FAR rule is to implement section 874 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2016 (FY 2016) (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/114/public/92" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub.

                             cash and/or Government obligations. This section was intended to strengthen coverage for individual sureties, thereby mitigating risk to the Government.

                            DoD, GSA, and NASA do not expect this rule to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>,

                             The final rule applies to all offerors and contractors who wish to use an individual surety as security for bonds required under a solicitation or contract for supplies or services (including construction). The number of solicitations and contracts requiring the submission of bid guarantees, performance bonds, or payment bonds, correlates roughly to the number of contract awards containing FAR clause 52.228-11, Pledge of Assets. Based on FY 2017 data contained in the Electronic Document Access system (DoD official contract file system), 8,603 DoD contract awards, containing FAR clause 52.228-11 with an obligated amount of over $35,000, were made to 1,990 unique vendors; of these 1,672 were small business entities. These contractors could be using corporate sureties under 28.202, individual sureties under 28.203, or pledging the contractor's own assets under 28.204; this FAR case only covers individual sureties under 28.203. Therefore, based on contracting officers' experience in the field DoD, GSA, and NASA estimate that less than 0.1 percent of contractors are using individual sureties to meet the required bonding under contracts.

                        <p id="p-36" data-page="3684">This final rule does not include additional reporting or recordkeeping requirements. Although the rule creates a new provision to distinguish instructions to offerors from instructions to a contractor by relocating the &ldquo;offeror&rdquo; language from the existing FAR clause at 52.228-11, Pledge of Assets, the net effect of projected reporting and recordkeeping is unchanged. The use of Standard Form (SF) 28, Affidavit of Individual Surety, an existing reporting requirement under 52.228-11, is covered under the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Control No. 9000-0001. The SF 28 is revised as a result of this rule. However, this will have a negligible impact on offerors, contractors, and respondents.</p>
                        <p id="p-37" data-page="3684">The effect on small business is that individual sureties will no longer be able to pledge real property, corporate stocks, corporate bonds, or irrevocable letters of credit. DoD, GSA, and NASA anticipate that some individual sureties may not want to transform their assets into the kind that qualify under the new legislation, and so there will be fewer individual sureties available to meet the needs of small business offerors and contractors. This may mean that some small businesses that have been using individual sureties will have their costs change, as they go to a different individual surety, or to a corporate surety.</p>
                        <p id="p-38" data-page="3684">There are no available alternatives to the rule to accomplish the desired objective of the statute.</p>
                        <p id="p-39" data-page="3684">DoD, GSA, and NASA do not expect this rule to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because this only applies to (1) offerors and contractors who are using an individual surety as security for bonds required under a solicitation or contract for supplies or services (including construction), and (2) individual sureties, a small number of whom may not want to transform their assets into the kind that qualify under the new legislation.</p>

This rule modifies the SF 28, which is used by all executive agencies to obtain information from individuals wishing to serve as sureties to Government bonds. However, the modification merely updates the language in the form to be consistent with the changes to the FAR text; it will have no impact on offerors or contractors.</p>
