                        There were no public comments submitted in response to the interim rule. Minor changes are made throughout the rule to remove references to section 802 of the NDAA for FY 2022. Those references are unnecessary, because section 802 has

                    <p id="p-9" data-page="46905">The clause at DFARS 252.225-7061, Restriction on the Acquisition of Personal Protective Equipment and Certain Other Items from Non-Allied Foreign Nations, is prescribed at DFARS 225.7023-4 for use in solicitations and contracts with an estimated value above $150,000, including solicitations and contracts using FAR part 12 procedures for the acquisition of commercial products, including COTS items, and commercial services, that are for the acquisition of covered items for use within the United States. Consistent with the determination that DoD made with regard to the application of the requirements of section 802 of the NDAA for FY 2022, DFARS clause 252.225-7061 applies to acquisitions above $150,000 and to contracts for the acquisition of commercial products, including COTS items, and commercial services.</p>

This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993.</p>

A major rule under the Congressional Review Act cannot take effect until 60 days after it is published in the

                        . The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has determined that this rule is not a major rule as defined by <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/804" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 804</a>.

                         and is summarized as follows:
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-13" data-page="46905">This final rule is necessary to finalize an interim rule that revised the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) to implement section 802 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/117/public/81" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub.

Section 802 restricts the acquisition of a covered item, defined as an article or item of personal protective equipment for use in preventing the spread of disease, such as by exposure to infected individuals or contamination or infection by infectious material, or other items for sanitizing and disinfecting, testing, gauze, and bandages, from The Democratic People's Republic of North Korea, The People's Republic of China, The Russian Federation, or The Islamic Republic of Iran. The objective of the rule is to finalize the implementation of section 802 of the NDAA for FY 2022.</p>
                    <p id="p-14" data-page="46905">There were no public comments received in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis.</p>

These contracts were awarded to 192 unique entities, of which 105 were small entities. It is not known what percentage of these awards might involve personal protective equipment and other materials and components from the Democratic People's Republic of North Korea, The People's Republic of China, The Russian Federation, or the Islamic Republic of Iran.</p>
                    <p id="p-16" data-page="46905">There are no projected reporting or recordkeeping requirements. However, there may be minor compliance costs to validate with suppliers the origin of covered items, materials, and components.</p>
