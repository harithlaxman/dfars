                        DoD published a proposed rule in the 
                        <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                         at <a href="/citation/84-FR-12182" class="fr-reference" data-reference="84 FR 12182">84 FR 12182</a> on April 1, 2019, to implement section 888 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/115/public/232" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 115-232</a>). Section 888 requires that the DFARS be updated to include an instruction on the demonstration project authorized by section 853 of the NDAA for FY 2004 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/108/public/136" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub.

Section 853 authorizes a demonstration project for contractors employing persons with disabilities in order to provide defense contracting opportunities for both nonprofit and for-profit entities employing individuals who have severe disabilities. Twenty respondents submitted public comments in response to the proposed rule.
                    </p>
                    <h2 id="h-8">II. Discussion and Analysis</h2>
                    <p id="p-7" data-page="72554">DoD reviewed the public comments in the development of the final rule. A discussion of the comments, and of the changes made to the rule as a result of those comments, is provided as follows:</p>
                    <h3 id="h-9">A. Summary of Significant Changes From the Proposed Rule</h3>
                    <p id="p-8" data-page="72554">This final rule makes the following significant changes from the proposed rule:</p>
                    <h4 id="h-10">1. Clarification of Procedures for Use of the Demonstration Project</h4>
                    <p id="p-9" data-page="72554">In DFARS subpart 226.72, Demonstration Project for Contractors Employing Persons with Disabilities, section 226.7200, Scope of subpart, is revised to clarify that subpart 226.72 does not supersede the requirements for contracting officers to use the mandatory sources in FAR part 8, Required Sources of Supplies and Services, or the small business programs in FAR part 19, Small Business Programs. This means that, depending on the specifics of a particular procurement, FAR part 8 or 19 may require a contracting officer to use a program other than the Demonstration Project for Contractors Employing Persons with Disabilities.</p>
                    <p id="p-10" data-page="72554">The text in DFARS 226.7202, Policy and procedures, is revised to clarify that, in order to limit competition to entities that meet the definition of &ldquo;eligible contractor,&rdquo; a written justification and approval is required pursuant to FAR 6.302-5, Authorized or required by statute. This means that prior to issuing the solicitation, contracting officers must explain, in writing, their rationale for using the Demonstration Project, and must obtain approval at the appropriate level based on the dollar value of the procurement.</p>
                    <p id="p-11" data-page="72554">
                        DFARS 226.7202 is also revised to require that, in order for DoD to continue to receive small disadvantaged business credit for a contract awarded under the Demonstration Project, the contractor must be an eligible contractor when options are exercised. Contracting officers are required to verify whether the contractor is still an eligible contractor (
                        <em>e.g.,</em>
                         by checking the representation in the System for Award Management (SAM)) prior to exercising an option on a contract awarded under the Demonstration Project. The contracting officer may exercise an option on a contract regardless of whether the contractor is still an eligible contractor, but DoD would only continue to receive small disadvantaged business credit for that contract if the contractor remains an eligible contractor under the Demonstration Project.
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="h-11">2. Clarification Regarding Subcontracts Under the Demonstration Project</h4>
                    <p id="p-12" data-page="72554">The final rule adds Alternate II for the clause at DFARS 252.219-7003, Small Business Subcontracting Plan (DoD Contracts), for use in solicitations and contracts issued under the Demonstration Project. Alternate II includes the definition of &ldquo;eligible contractor&rdquo; and allows the prime contractor to receive credit toward its small disadvantaged business subcontracting goal for subcontracts issued to eligible contractors. This final rule does not include, in the basic or Alternate I clause at DFARS 252.219-7003, the definition of &ldquo;eligible contractor&rdquo; and the statement regarding credit toward the small disadvantaged business subcontracting goal. The effect of this changes is that only eligible contractors that have contracts awarded under the Demonstration Project will receive credit toward their small disadvantaged business subcontracting goal for subcontracts they award to other eligible contractors under Demonstration Project contracts. The prescription for use of Alternate II of DFARS 252.219-7003 is added at DFARS 219.708.</p>
                    <h4 id="h-12">3. Clarification of Applicability to Commercial Items</h4>
                    <p id="p-13" data-page="72554">To clarify that contracting officers may use the Demonstration Project to purchase commercial items, including commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) items, this final rule adds the following provision and clause to section 212.301, Solicitation provisions and contract clauses for the acquisition of commercial items:</p>
                    
            <ul class="bullets" >

                    <h4 id="h-14">1. Support for the Rule</h4>

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         A few respondents commented on the need for clarity about the types of procurements that would be eligible for the Demonstration Project, particularly with regard to the product service codes (PSCs) listed in the proposed rule. One respondent requested confirmation that the Demonstration Project would be used

                        <em>Response:</em>
                         Section 853 does not impose limitations on the products or services that may be procured under the Demonstration Project. The PSCs listed in the

                         notice for the proposed rule were used merely to estimate the potential opportunities Congress identified in the Conference Report for the NDAA for FY 2004. The list of PSCs was not intended to limit the procurements that could be conducted under the Demonstration Project.

                    <h4 id="h-17">b. Applicability of the Demonstration Project at or Below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold and to Commercial Items</h4>
                    <p id="p-20" data-page="72555">
                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent commented on the applicability of the Demonstration Project to acquisitions at or below the simplified acquisition threshold (SAT) and to acquisitions of commercial items. The respondent stated that the Demonstration Project should be limited to commercial items under the SAT, and that to apply the Demonstration Project to all commercial item acquisitions would have a wider impact than Congress intended.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-21" data-page="72555">
                        <em>Response:</em>
                         Section 853 did not limit the procurements that could be conducted under the Demonstration Project with regard to dollar value or the commercial (or noncommercial) nature of the product or service to be procured. By applying section 853 to acquisitions at or below the SAT, DoD allows these low dollar value procurements to be conducted under the Demonstration Project. In other words, the Demonstration Project could be used to buy products or services valued at or below the SAT. Similarly, applying section 853 to acquisitions of commercial items, including COTS items, allows these items to be procured under the Demonstration Project. For the reasons stated in section IV of this preamble, DoD has determined that it is in the Government's best interest to allow acquisitions at or below the SAT and acquisitions of commercial items, including COTS items, to be conducted under the Demonstration Project.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent asked how DoD would &ldquo;determine the suitability&rdquo; of a procurement for the Demonstration Project. In particular, the respondent asked if DoD would &ldquo;apply the Rule of Two like other Small Business programs.&rdquo;
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-23" data-page="72555">
                        <em>Response:</em>
                         Contracting officers may elect to use the Demonstration Project for a particular procurement, but they are not required to do so. FAR part 10 requires agencies to conduct market research, and contracting officers will use the results of market research to determine whether a particular procurement may be appropriate for the Demonstration Project. The Demonstration Project is not a small business program. Therefore, the rule of two in FAR part 19 does not apply. However, section 853 does not provide authority to award contracts on a sole-source basis (
                        <em>i.e.,</em>
                         without competition), so there is an expectation that procurements under the Demonstration Project will be competed unless a sole-source award is justified and approved based on another authority.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         Two respondents recommended allowing credit toward the small disadvantaged business goal for current and future contracts awarded to AbilityOne nonprofits that also qualify as eligible contractors under the Demonstration Project. Several respondents recommended continuing the small disadvantaged business credit for Demonstration Project contracts that are later added to the AbilityOne Procurement List.

                        <em>Response:</em>
                         There is no statutory authority for DoD to implement the respondents' recommendations. Section 853 provides credit for DoD toward its small disadvantaged business goal only for contracts awarded to eligible contractors under the Demonstration Project. This credit does not extend to contracts awarded outside the Demonstration Project. There is no statutory authority to provide small disadvantaged business credit for contracts for products or services on the Procurement List.

                         Several respondents expressed concern that allowing DoD to receive credit toward its small disadvantaged business goal for contracts awarded under the Demonstration Project would have an adverse impact on AbilityOne nonprofits' ability to add projects to the AbilityOne Procurement List.

                         The authority to add products or services to the Procurement List resides with the U.S. AbilityOne Commission, which has its own process to make such additions. Addressing this process in the DFARS is outside the scope of this rule.

                         Several respondents commented on the description of procurements made under the Demonstration Project in section III of the preamble of the proposed rule and recommended clarifying that a &ldquo;valid purchase exception&rdquo; must be granted by an appropriate authority in the AbilityOne Program. Some respondents stated that products and services on the Procurement List should not be eligible for award under the Demonstration Project. One respondent recommended modifying DFARS 226.7202 to require contracting officers to ensure compliance with FAR 8.002 and subpart 8.7 prior to conducting market research and developing a solicitation under the Demonstration Project.

                         The final rule includes a clarification at DFARS 226.7200 that nothing in DFARS subpart 226.72 supersedes the requirement to use the mandatory sources in FAR part 8, Required Sources of Supplies and Services, or the small business programs in FAR part 19, Small Business Programs.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         Two respondents commented that they believe it was the intent of Congress to allow AbilityOne nonprofits to be eligible to participate in the Demonstration Project. One respondent noted that there appear to be limits on the participation of AbilityOne nonprofits in procurements conducted under the Demonstration Project. Two respondents argued that there should be a presumption of eligibility for AbilityOne nonprofits to participate in procurements under the Demonstration Project.

                         Any entity that meets the definition of &ldquo;eligible contractor&rdquo; may participate in a procurement conducted under the Demonstration Project. While AbilityOne nonprofit agencies are likely to meet the Demonstration Project requirement that at least 33 percent of their workforce must be severely disabled individuals, the statutory definition of &ldquo;eligible contractor&rdquo; in section 853 goes beyond the percentage. The definition includes other requirements (
                        <em>e.g.,</em>
                         health insurance, minimum wage) that a specific nonprofit agency may or may not meet. Therefore, the eligibility of any entity for the Demonstration Project cannot be presumed.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         Two respondents objected to allowing DoD to receive credit toward its small disadvantaged business goal for contracts awarded under the Demonstration Project, since such credit should only be allowed for awards to small businesses that qualify as disadvantaged under the Small Business Administration's rules. One respondent commented that it appears prime contractors who are not eligible contractors under the Demonstration Project could obtain credit toward their small disadvantaged business subcontracting goal for subcontracts awarded to eligible contractors. Another respondent recommended changing &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in paragraph (c) of the proposed text at DFARS 226.7202 to more closely align with section 853.

L. 108-199</a>), which required that contracts awarded under the Demonstration Project to eligible contractors be counted toward DoD's small disadvantaged business goal, and that subcontracts awarded to eligible contractors under these contracts be counted toward the prime contractor's small disadvantaged business goal. Therefore, this final rule requires these contracts and subcontracts to be counted toward the small disadvantaged business goal.

The final rule provides clarification by adding Alternate II for the clause at DFARS 252.219-7003, Small Business Subcontracting Plan (DoD Contracts), specifically for use in procurements conducted under the Demonstration Project. Alternate II will appear in contracts awarded under the Demonstration Project, not in any other contracts, so it should be clear that this credit is available only if the prime contract was awarded under the Demonstration Project.</p>

                         If a contract awarded under the Demonstration Project meets the requirements for a subcontracting plan at FAR 19.702, then a subcontracting plan is required. Section 853 does not provide relief from this requirement. FAR 19.702 states that subcontracting plans are not required from small businesses. It is not necessary to repeat this in the DFARS, since DoD contracting officers use the DFARS in conjunction with the FAR. Clarification regarding applicability of the subcontracting plan requirement to AbilityOne nonprofit agencies is outside the scope of this DFARS rule.

                         The statutory authority for the Demonstration Project does not provide limits on subcontracting for eligible contractors. To the extent an eligible contractor decides to subcontract part of the work under a Demonstration Project contract, there is an incentive for them to subcontract to other eligible contractors because they receive credit toward their small disadvantaged business subcontracting goal for those subcontracts.

One respondent questioned whether the 33 percent requirement applied to the entity's total workforce or only to employees for a specific contract, as well as whether it applied to full-time and part-time employees. Another respondent supported applying the 33 percent requirement to the entity's total workforce. One respondent recommended requiring performance of the contract by disabled individuals. Another respondent recommended, to the extent feasible, clarifying how a contractor can ascertain in good faith its compliance with the requirement to offer health insurance and retirement plan that are comparable to those offered by entities of similar size in its industrial sector or geographic region.

                         The 33 percent requirement applies to the entity's total workforce. To qualify for a contract under the Demonstration Project, eligible contractors are required to employ severely disabled individuals at a rate of 33 percent of their total workforce over the 12-month period prior to issuance of the solicitation. The final rule has been revised to require contracting officers to verify whether the contractor is still an eligible contractor (
                        <em>e.g.,</em>
                         by checking the representation in SAM) prior to exercising an option under a contract awarded under the Demonstration Project. The contracting officer may decide to exercise an option on the contract if the contractor has represented that it is not an eligible contractor, but DoD will not continue to receive small disadvantaged business credit for that contract.

                         a transition phase of 2 or 3 years building up to 33 percent or allow a prime contractor and subcontractor working together to meet the requirement.

                    <h2 id="h-43">III. Expected Impact of the Rule</h2>
                    <p id="p-69" data-page="72558">The Demonstration Project allows DoD to provide additional contracting opportunities to entities that employ individuals who are severely disabled. Procurements under the Demonstration Project must be for products and services that are not on the AbilityOne Procurement List, or for which the designated central nonprofit agency has granted a purchase exception.</p>
                    <p id="p-70" data-page="72558">The Demonstration Project is modeled after the Small Business Administration's set-aside program, but uniquely includes an incentive for Federal contractors to hire people with disabilities who currently receive Social Security benefits. Such a demonstration project provides opportunities for severely disabled individuals to become gainfully employed taxpayers. Employing people with disabilities can be a way to offset the effects of an aging and shrinking workforce. In addition, people with disabilities bring different perspectives on solving problems and adapting to different circumstances. The Demonstration Project provides another incentive for both for-profit and nonprofit entities to recruit, employ, and retain people with disabilities.</p>
                    <p id="p-71" data-page="72558">DoD estimates that there may be approximately 549 procurements conducted under the Demonstration Project per year, based on data obtained from the Federal Procurement Data System. Specifically, DoD examined the number of contracts awarded to nonprofits in product service codes (PSCs) that may be suitable for award under the Demonstration Project. The selection of PSCs was informed by the Conference Report for the NDAA for FY 2004, which authorized the Demonstration Project. The Conference Report indicated that Congress expected opportunities to exist for the Demonstration Project in aerospace end items and components, as well as information technology products and services. It is important to note that use of these PSCs to estimate the number of procurements that may be conducted under the Demonstration Project does not limit such procurements to these PSCs. Opportunities may exist for the Demonstration Project in other PSCs.</p>
                    <p id="p-72" data-page="72558">DoD obtained data for contracts awarded in the following PSCs:</p>

                    <p id="p-73" data-page="72558">In certain PSCs, there is some overlap with the Procurement List maintained by the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled. The areas of overlap generally included a few items within a specific PSC, not the entire PSC. Therefore, relevant PSCs were included regardless of possible overlap with the Procurement List.</p>
                    <p id="p-74" data-page="72558">DoD also used awards to nonprofits as an indicator of suitability for the Demonstration Project because of its similarities to the AbilityOne Program, in terms of employment of individuals with severe disabilities. From FY 2016 through 2018, an average of 0.16 percent of those contracts (approximately 90 each year) were awarded to nonprofits. Since the Demonstration Project applies to both for-profit and nonprofit entities, DoD conservatively estimated that up to 1 percent of contracts (approximately 549 each year) awarded in those PSCs may be suitable for the Demonstration Project.</p>
                    <p id="p-75" data-page="72558">This rule requires offerors for procurements conducted under the Demonstration Project to represent whether they are or are not eligible contractors as defined in the rule. Offerors will complete the representation in SAM. The cost associated with the representation is expected to be de minimis and is within the estimate of public burden for OMB Control Number 9000-0159, System for Award Management Registration.</p>

The majority of contracts that could be awarded under the Demonstration Project are likely to be valued at or below the SAT. Similarly, the majority of the products and services offered by these contractors are commercial items, including COTS items. Therefore, DoD has determined that it is in the best interest of the Federal Government to apply the rule to contracts valued at or below the SAT and contracts for the acquisition of commercial items, including COTS items. It is expected that contracting officers would likely be unable to utilize the Demonstration Project established by Congress, if this rule is not applied to these categories of contracts.</p>

                        A final regulatory flexibility analysis (FRFA) has been prepared consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>, 
                        <em>et seq.</em>
                         The FRFA is summarized as follows:
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-83" data-page="72559">DoD is amending the DFARS to include an instruction on the Demonstration Project for Contractors Employing Persons with Disabilities, as required by section 888 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/115/public/232" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 115-232</a>). The Demonstration Project allows DoD to provide defense contracting opportunities to entities that employ individuals who are severely disabled. Nothing in this final DFARS rule supersedes the requirement to use the mandatory sources in FAR part 8 or the small business programs in FAR part 19.</p>
                    <p id="p-84" data-page="72559">There were no significant issues raised by the public in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis.</p>
                    <p id="p-85" data-page="72559">The rule will apply to entities, including small entities, that meet the definition of &ldquo;eligible contractor&rdquo; in the rule and that are interested in competing for contracts under the Demonstration Project. Specifically, an eligible contractor is one that employs severely disabled individuals at a rate of no less than 33 percent of the contractor's workforce over a 12-month period prior to issuance of the solicitation; pays not less than the minimum wage to those individuals; and provides health insurance and a retirement plan comparable to those provided by similar entities. The entity may operate on a for-profit or nonprofit basis.</p>
                    <p id="p-86" data-page="72559">According to data in FPDS, DoD awarded contracts to approximately 4,065 small entities each year from FY 2016 to FY 2018 in product and service codes (PSCs) that may be suitable for award under the Demonstration Project, such as aerospace components and accessories and information technology equipment and services. DoD conservatively estimates that approximately 21 percent, or 870 small entities, may meet the definition of &ldquo;eligible contractor&rdquo; and be interested in competing for contracts under the Demonstration Project.</p>
                    <p id="p-87" data-page="72559">This rule requires offerors to represent whether they are or are not eligible contractors under the Demonstration Project. This representation will be available for completion in SAM and will be completed on an annual basis. This rule does not impose any additional recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities.</p>
                    <p id="p-88" data-page="72559">DoD considered more extensive recordkeeping requirements related to the definition of &ldquo;eligible contractor,&rdquo; particularly with regard to the percentage of the entity's workforce that consists of severely disabled individuals. Such recordkeeping requirements would be burdensome for small entities. At this time, DoD does not have sufficient data on the use of the Demonstration Project to determine whether this burden would be necessary. Therefore, DoD will rely on the representation requirement described above until sufficient data can be collected on the Demonstration Project to determine if more extensive requirements are needed.</p>
                    <h2 id="h-51">VIII. Paperwork Reduction Act</h2>
                    <p id="p-89" data-page="72559">This rule affects the information collection requirements in the provision at FAR 52.204-7, System for Award Management, and in the clause at FAR 52.204-13, System for Award Management Maintenance, currently approved under OMB Control Number 9000-0159, entitled System for Award Management Registration, in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/44/3501" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44 U.S.C. chapter 35</a>). The impact, however, is negligible, because the cost of providing the additional representation in SAM is de minimis and is within the estimate of public burden approved for OMB Control Number 9000-0159.</p>
