L. 112-81</a>), entitled &ldquo;Authority to Order Army Reserve, Navy Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve, and Air Force Reserve to Active Duty to Provide Assistance in Response to a Major Disaster or Emergency,&rdquo; amends <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/120901" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chapter 1209 of title 10, United States Code</a>, by incorporating a new provision at section 12304a that provides for treatment of an operation as a contingency operation when the Secretary of Defense activates Reserves under the terms of <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/12304a" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 12304a</a> in response to a Governor's request for Federal assistance in responding to a major disaster or emergency declared by the President.</p>

                    <p id="p-9" data-page="46781">The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council (Councils) reviewed the public comments in the development of the final rule.</p>
                    <p id="p-10" data-page="46781">Only one comment was received. The respondent indicated that it concurred with the interim rule. Therefore, no change to the interim rule was deemed necessary for the final rule.</p>

                        Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">Executive Order 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993.

                        DoD, GSA, and NASA have prepared a Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (FRFA) consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>, 
                        <em>et seq.</em>
                         The FRFA is summarized as follows:
                    </p>
                    
                        <p id="p-13" data-page="46782">
                            Expanding the definition of &ldquo;contingency operation&rdquo; to include responding to a Presidential declaration of a major disaster or emergency (as defined in section 102 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/42/5122" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">42 U.S.C. 5122</a>)) will increase the circumstances under which &ldquo;contingency operations&rdquo; may be declared, thereby allowing defense and civilian agencies to raise thresholds (
                            <em>i.e.,</em>
                             micro-purchase and simplified acquisition thresholds) for acquisitions made in support of emergencies in accordance with the authorities listed at FAR 18.201, and exercise preferences, such as local area set-asides or evaluation preferences.
                        </p>
                        <p id="p-14" data-page="46782">Because &ldquo;local businesses&rdquo; may vary in size and business ownership, and the locations of disasters vary, we do not expect the amendment to have a direct and sustained economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. However, there is the possibility that, because the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act provides for a preference for local organizations, firms, and individuals when contracting for major disaster or emergency activities, implementation of the revised definition for &ldquo;contingency operation&rdquo; may increase opportunities for awarding contracts to small entities located at or near major disaster areas or emergency activities.</p>
                        <p id="p-15" data-page="46782">In addition, FAR 19.502-2(a) requires simplified acquisitions during a contingency operation within the United States ($300,000 instead of $150,000) to be automatically reserved for small businesses (with the usual exceptions). The ability to restrict purchases up to two times the normal simplified acquisition threshold for small businesses will have a significant positive impact on small entities.</p>
