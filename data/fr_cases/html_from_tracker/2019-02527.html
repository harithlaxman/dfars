                    DoD published a proposed rule in the 
                    <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                     at <a href="/citation/83-FR-54698" class="fr-reference" data-reference="83 FR 54698">83 FR 54698</a> on October 31, 2018, to implement sections 221 and 861 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/115/public/91" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 115-91</a>).
                </p>
                <p id="p-7" data-page="4364">Section 221 amends <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2302" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2302(2)(B)</a> to allow for an expanded application of other competitive procedures by replacing the words &ldquo;basic research&rdquo; with &ldquo;science and technology&rdquo;. &ldquo;Competitive procedures&rdquo; were defined in <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2302" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2302(2)(B)</a> to include &ldquo;the competitive selection for award of basic research proposals resulting from a general solicitation, and the peer review or scientific review (as appropriate) of such proposals.&rdquo; Changing the words &ldquo;basic research&rdquo; to &ldquo;science and technology&rdquo; expands the meaning of other competitive procedures to apply to &ldquo;advanced technology development&rdquo; and &ldquo;advanced component development and prototypes&rdquo; research proposals, in addition to &ldquo;basic research&rdquo; and &ldquo;applied research&rdquo; proposals. One of the solicitation methods for research and development proposals, a broad agency announcement (BAA), is defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) as &ldquo;a general announcement of an agency's research interest including criteria for selecting proposals and soliciting the participation of all offerors capable of satisfying the Government's needs.&rdquo; Section 221 permits the use of BAAs for competitive selection of science and technology proposals by authorizing the use of the competitive procedures at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2302" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2302(2)(B)</a> that result from a general solicitation and peer or scientific review of such proposals&mdash;a key element of the BAA process.</p>

                <p id="p-10" data-page="4364">DoD reviewed the public comment in the development of the final rule. A discussion of the comment received and any changes made to the rule is provided as follows:</p>
                <h3 id="h-9">A. Summary of Significant Changes</h3>
                <p id="p-11" data-page="4364">DoD did not make any changes to the proposed rule as a result of the public comment.</p>
                <h3 id="h-10">B. Analysis of Public Comment</h3>
                <p id="p-12" data-page="4364">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     The respondent recommended the proposed rule update 213.106-1(b) to address documentation requirements related to competition for actions not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold (SAT).
                </p>
                <p id="p-13" data-page="4364">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     Since there is no DFARS 213.106-1(b) section, DoD reviewed FAR 13.106-1(b), Soliciting Competition, which allows contracting officers to solicit from a single source, for purchases not exceeding the SAT, if the contracting officer determines that circumstances deem only one source reasonably available. This rule relates to soliciting proposals using other competitive procedures (such as a broad agency announcement) and is not related to solicitations of a single source for purchases not exceeding the SAT; 
                    <span class="printed-page-inline unprinted-element document-markup" data-page="4365">

      (<svg class="svg-icon svg-icon-doc-generic"><use xlink:href="/assets/fr-icons.svg#doc-generic"></use></svg> printed page 4365)
    </span><span class="printed-page-details unprinted-element document-markup" id="page-4365" data-page="4365"><svg class="svg-icon svg-icon-doc-generic"><use xlink:href="/assets/fr-icons.svg#doc-generic"></use></svg></span>
                    therefore, DoD determined that the public comment is outside the scope of this rule.
                </p>
                <h3 id="h-11">C. Other Changes</h3>
                <p id="p-14" data-page="4365">One minor editorial change is made to the final rule. DoD compared the proposed rule to the current version of the DFARS text and noted the need to correct a typo at DFARS 215.371-4(a) by changing the word &ldquo;sections&rdquo; to &ldquo;section&rdquo;.</p>
                <h2 id="h-12">III. Applicability to Contracts at or Below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold and for Commercial Items, Including Commercially Available Off-the-Shelf Items</h2>
                <p id="p-15" data-page="4365">This rule does not add any new provisions or clauses or impact any existing provisions or clauses.</p>
                <h2 id="h-13">IV. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563</h2>
                <p id="p-16" data-page="4365">Executive Order (E.O.s) 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review; and <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a>, Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review, direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993.

</h2>
                <p id="p-17" data-page="4365">This final rule is not an <a href="/executive-order/13771" class="eo">E.O. 13771</a> regulatory action, because this rule is not significant under <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>.</p>
                <h2 id="h-15">VI. Regulatory Flexibility Act</h2>
                <p id="p-18" data-page="4365">A final regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared and is summarized as follows:</p>
                <p id="p-19" data-page="4365">This rule proposes to amend the DFARS to implement sections 221 and 861 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2018.</p>
                <p id="p-20" data-page="4365">Section 221 expands the definition of &ldquo;competitive procedures&rdquo; at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2302" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2302(2)(B)</a> by removing the term &ldquo;basic research&rdquo; and adding &ldquo;science and technology&rdquo; in its place. Section 861 implements a statutory modification to <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2302e" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2302e</a> to extend the term limit and dollar threshold for the contract authority for advanced development of initial or additional prototype units from 12 months to 2 years and from $20 million to $100 million in fiscal year 2017 constant dollars (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2302e" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2302e</a>), respectively. The modification also repeals the obsolete authority of section 819 of the NDAA for FY 2010 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/111/public/84" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 111-84</a>), thereby eliminating the expiration date of September 30, 2019, for the contract authority for advanced development of initial or additional prototype units.</p>
                <p id="p-21" data-page="4365">The objective of this rule is to implement sections 221 and 861 to establish broad agency announcements as a competitive procedure that may be used to select science and technology proposals and to expand the term limit and dollar threshold for the contract authority for advanced development of initial or additional prototype units. This rule impacts internal Government procedures by expanding the meaning of other competitive procedures to include the competitive selection of science and technology proposals and expands the contract authority for advanced development of initial or additional prototype units.</p>
                <p id="p-22" data-page="4365">There were no public comments concerning the initial regulatory flexibility analysis.</p>
                <p id="p-23" data-page="4365">In FY 2017, DoD awarded 1,853 contracts for research and development, excluding Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Technology Transfer Research (STTR) program requirements. Approximately 53% of those new contract actions were awarded to 1,005 of unique small business and nontraditional DoD entities. There were 2,858 new contract awards for SBIR and STTR program requirements for DoD. Approximately 66% of those new contract actions were awarded to 1,891 of unique small business and nontraditional DoD entities.</p>
                <p id="p-24" data-page="4365">This final rule does not include any new reporting or recordkeeping requirements for small entities.</p>
                <p id="p-25" data-page="4365">There are no known significant alternative approaches to the final rule that would meet the requirements of the applicable statute.</p>
                <h2 id="h-16">VI. Paperwork Reduction Act</h2>
                <p id="p-26" data-page="4365">This final rule does not contain any information collection requirements that require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/44/3501" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44 U.S.C. chapter 35</a>).</p>
