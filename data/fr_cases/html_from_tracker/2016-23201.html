L. 114-92</a>). Section 811 amended subsection (a)(1) of <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2306b" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2306b</a> by striking &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; and inserting &ldquo;significant.&rdquo; This rule makes conforming changes at FAR 17.105-1(b)(1) to state that the head of an agency may enter into a multi-year contract for supplies, if the use of such a contract will result in significant savings of the total estimated costs of carrying out the program through annual contracts. This change applies to the DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.</p>

                        Acquisition Regulation. Paragraph (a)(1) of the statute requires that a procurement policy, regulation, procedure, or form (including an amendment or modification thereof) must be published for public comment if it relates to the expenditure of appropriated funds, and has either a significant effect beyond the internal operating procedures of the agency issuing the policy, regulation, procedure, or form, or has a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors. This final rule is not required to be published for public comment, because it addresses an internal decision by the head of agency to enter into a multi-year contract for supplies if certain criteria are met. These requirements affect only the internal operating procedures of the Government.

                    <p id="p-8" data-page="67774">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility.
