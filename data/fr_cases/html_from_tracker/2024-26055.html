                <h2 id="h-7">I. Background</h2>
                <p id="p-6" data-page="90237">DoD is issuing a final rule amending the DFARS to implement section 865 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/118/public/31" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 118-31</a>). Section 865 requires DoD contracting officers to consider relevant past performance of affiliate companies of small business concerns during the evaluation of past performance in response to a competitive solicitation.</p>
                <h2 id="h-8">II. Publication of This Final Rule for Public Comment Is Not Required by Statute</h2>
                <p id="p-7" data-page="90237">The statute that applies to the publication of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) is <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1707" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1707</a>, Publication of Proposed Regulations. Subsection (a)(1) of the statute requires that a procurement policy, regulation, procedure, or form (including an amendment or modification thereof) must be published for public comment if it relates to the expenditure of appropriated funds and has either a significant effect beyond the internal operating procedures of the agency issuing the policy, regulation, procedure, or form, or has a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors. This final rule is not required to be published for public comment, because there is no significant cost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors. When past performance will be evaluated in a source selection, contracting officers already request offerors to submit past performance information. This rule will allow offerors to provide past performance information for an affiliate company within that submission, and the Government would consider those submissions during the existing evaluation process.</p>
                <h2 id="h-9">III. Applicability to Contracts At or Below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT), for Commercial Products (Including Commercially Available Off-the-Shelf (COTS) Items), and for Commercial Services</h2>
                <p id="p-8" data-page="90237">This final rule does not create any new solicitation provisions or contract clauses. It does not impact any existing solicitation provisions or contract clauses or their applicability to contracts valued at or below the simplified acquisition threshold, for commercial products including COTS items, or for commercial services.</p>
                <h2 id="h-10">IV. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563</h2>
                <p id="p-9" data-page="90237">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, as amended.</p>
                <h2 id="h-11">V. Congressional Review Act</h2>
                <p id="p-10" data-page="90237">
                    As required by the Congressional Review Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/801" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 801-808</a>) before an interim or final rule takes effect, DoD will submit a copy of the interim or final rule with the form, Submission of Federal Rules Under the Congressional Review Act, to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Comptroller General of the United States. A major rule under the Congressional Review Act cannot take effect until 60 days after it is published in the 
                    <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                    . The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has determined that this rule is not a major rule as defined by <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/804" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 804</a>.
                </p>
                <h2 id="h-12">VI. Regulatory Flexibility Act</h2>
                <p id="p-11" data-page="90237">The Regulatory Flexibility Act does not apply to this rule because this final rule does not constitute a significant DFARS revision within the meaning of FAR 1.501-1, and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1707" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1707</a> does not require publication for public comment.</p>
                <h2 id="h-13">VII. Paperwork Reduction Act</h2>
                <p id="p-12" data-page="90237">This final rule does not contain any information collection requirements that require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/44/3501" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44 U.S.C. chapter 35</a>).</p>
