                <p id="p-6" data-page="71465">
                    DoD published an interim rule in the 
                    <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                     at <a href="/citation/76-FR-38050" class="fr-reference" data-reference="76 FR 38050">76 FR 38050</a> on June 29, 2011, to amend Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 215.304(c) by adding paragraph (iv) to state that the manufacturing readiness and manufacturing-readiness processes of potential contractors and subcontractors shall be considered as a part of the source selection process for major defense acquisition programs. No public comments were submitted in response to the interim rule.
                </p>
                <h2 id="h-8">II. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563</h2>
                <p id="p-7" data-page="71465">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993. This rule is not a major rule under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/804" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 804</a>.</p>
                <h2 id="h-9">III. Regulatory Flexibility Act</h2>
                <p id="p-8" data-page="71465">
                    A Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has been prepared consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>, 
                    <em>et seq.,</em>
                     and is summarized as follows:
                </p>
                <p id="p-9" data-page="71465">This final rule amends the DFARS to implement section 812 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011, (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2430" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2430 note</a>). Section 812(b)(5) requires appropriate consideration of the manufacturing readiness and manufacturing-readiness processes of potential contractors and subcontractors as a part of the source selection process for major defense acquisition programs.</p>
                <p id="p-10" data-page="71465">No public comments were received in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis. No comments were filed by the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration in response to the interim rule.</p>
                <p id="p-11" data-page="71465">The rule will apply to DoD Major Defense Acquisition Program contractors and subcontractors. Most major defense acquisition programs are awarded to large concerns as these programs are of a scope too large for any small business to perform. As such, it is not expected that this rule will have a significant impact on a significant number of small entities.</p>
                <p id="p-12" data-page="71465">The final rule imposes no reporting, recordkeeping, or other information collection requirements.</p>
                <p id="p-13" data-page="71465">There are no known significant alternatives to the rule that would meet the requirements of the statute. The impact on small entities is expected to be positive.</p>
                <h2 id="h-10">IV. Paperwork Reduction Act</h2>
                <p id="p-14" data-page="71465">The rule does not contain any information collection requirements that require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/44/3501" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44 U.S.C. chapter 35</a>).</p>
