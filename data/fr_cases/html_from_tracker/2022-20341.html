                    <h2 id="h-7">I. Background</h2>
                    <p id="p-6" data-page="58228">DoD, GSA, and NASA published a proposed rule at <a href="/citation/85-FR-18181" class="fr-reference" data-reference="85 FR 18181">85 FR 18181</a> on April 1, 2020, to implement section 855 of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 (Pub. L. 115&mdash;232), codified at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/15/644" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15 U.S.C. 644(w)</a> in the Small Business Act.</p>
                    <p id="p-7" data-page="58228">Section 855 requires Federal agencies to provide a notice, along with solicitations for construction contracts anticipated to be awarded to small businesses, to prospective offerors that includes information about the agency's policies or practices in complying with FAR requirements related to the timely definitization of requests for equitable adjustment on construction contracts. Definitization of requests for equitable adjustment occurs after the contracting officer receives, reviews, and conducts an analysis and audit of the information contained in a change order proposal, and results in an executed contractual action. The notice must also include data regarding the time it took the agency to definitize requests for equitable adjustment on construction contracts for the three-year period preceding the issuance of the notice.</p>
                    <p id="p-8" data-page="58228">FAR 36.211 requires agencies to furnish data for the three fiscal years preceding the issuance of the solicitation notice.</p>
                    <p id="p-9" data-page="58228">Six respondents submitted public comments in response to the proposed rule.</p>
                    <h2 id="h-8">II. Discussion and Analysis</h2>
                    <p id="p-10" data-page="58228">The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council (the Councils) reviewed the public comments in the development of the final rule. A discussion of the comments received, and any changes made to the rule as a result of the public comments are provided as follows:</p>
                    <h3 id="h-9">A. Summary of Significant Changes From the Proposed Rule</h3>
                    <p id="p-11" data-page="58228">The following significant changes from the proposed rule are made in the final rule:</p>
                    <h4 id="h-10">(1) Removal of Provision 52.236-XX; Replaced by Solicitation Notice</h4>
                    <p id="p-12" data-page="58228">The final rule FAR text removes the proposed solicitation provision 52.236-XX, Notice Regarding Administration of Change Orders for Construction. The provision is replaced with an instruction to the contracting officer at FAR subpart 5.2, Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions. Specifically, 5.205(h), Special situations, requires contracting officers to transmit a notice in the solicitation notice on the Governmentwide point of entry (GPE) to meet the requirements of section 855 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/15/644" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15 U.S. C. 644(w)</a>).</p>
                    <p id="p-13" data-page="58228">The final rule FAR text removes the proposed text at FAR subpart 36.5, Contract Clauses, and replaces it with text at subpart 36.2, Special Aspects of Contracting for Construction. Specifically, paragraph (b) is added to FAR section 36.211 to coincide with FAR 5.205(h) and to provide specifics on the information required in the solicitation notice. This change will allow agencies more flexibility to share their specific guidance or to provide explanatory commentary. The text from the removed provision, 52.236-XX, is converted into the text for the solicitation notice.</p>
                    <h4 id="h-11">(2) Removal of &ldquo;publicly accessible website&rdquo; and &ldquo;website to be determined&rdquo;; Replaced with &ldquo;agency specific, publicly accessible website&rdquo; and &ldquo;follow agency procedures&rdquo; </h4>
                    <p id="p-14" data-page="58228">FAR 36.211(b) requires contracting officers to provide a description of applicable policies or procedures in the notice or through &ldquo;an address of an agency-specific, publicly accessible website&rdquo; containing this information rather than through a provision to be filled in or a &ldquo;publicly accessible website.&rdquo; The agency's past performance data will be included in the table format provided at FAR 36.211(b) or on an agency-specific, publicly accessible website in lieu of a &ldquo;website to be determined&rdquo; as stated in the proposed rule.</p>
                    <p id="p-15" data-page="58228">This change will allow agencies more flexibility in how to share their specific guidance, and to provide explanatory commentary when appropriate.</p>
                    <h4 id="h-12">(3) Clarifications</h4>
                    <p id="p-16" data-page="58228">The final rule makes revisions at FAR part 43, Contract Modifications. Specifically, FAR 43.204(b)(3)(ii), regarding recording and maintaining data for definitizing equitable adjustments, is moved to paragraph (b)(1)(ii) to clarify that the requirement applies to all change orders. This paragraph replaces in two places the phrase &ldquo;shall use [website to be determined]&rdquo; with a reference to agency procedures to allow more flexibility in recording and maintaining the required data.</p>
                    <h4 id="h-13">(4) Measurement of the Definitization of Equitable Adjustments</h4>
                    <p id="p-17" data-page="58228">The final rule revises FAR 43.204(b)(1)(ii), previously FAR 43.204(b)(3)(ii) in the proposed rule, to identify the measurement of the definitization of equitable adjustments by including the following sentence: &ldquo;The definitization of an equitable adjustment begins upon receipt of an adequate change order definitization proposal by the contracting officer and ends upon the contracting officer's execution of a contractual action to definitize the change order.&rdquo;</p>
                    <h3 id="h-14">B. Analysis of Public Comments</h3>
                    <h4 id="h-15">1. Applicability/Authority for Appropriations</h4>
                    <p id="p-18" data-page="58228">
                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent stated that NDAA appropriations are not applicable to non-DoD agencies. The respondent stated that the law should be incorporated into the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) instead of the FAR.

                        <em>Response:</em>
                         Congress often uses the annual NDAA as a vehicle for making Governmentwide acquisition law changes. In this instance, Congress amended section 15 of the Small Business Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/15/644" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15 U.S.C. 644</a>) in section 855 of the John S. McCain NDAA for FY 2019 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/115/public/232" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 115-232</a>). The new requirements are codified at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/15/644" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15 U.S.C. 644(w)</a>. Since section 15 of the Small Business Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/15/644" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15 U.S.C. 644</a>) has Governmentwide applicability, it is appropriate for the requirements to be implemented in the FAR. No changes were made to the final rule as a result of this comment.

                    <h4 id="h-16">2. Past Performance Data</h4>
                    <p id="p-20" data-page="58228">
                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent stated that the rule should allow agencies an opportunity to explain factors contributing to the time required to resolve equitable adjustments as the reasons are often beyond the Government's control. The respondent stated that historical data without context is irrelevant to predicting future time frames and otherwise makes the data meaningless.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-21" data-page="58228">Another respondent noted that construction contracts are usually administered by individual construction contract administration offices near the project site. The respondent stated that collecting agency-wide past performance data is not indicative of future time frames and cannot be correlated to accurately anticipate future conduct of an administering office. The respondent stated that the rule should be amended to allow agencies an opportunity to account for a contract change's specific facts and circumstances; otherwise, the data is meaningless.</p>
                    <p id="p-22" data-page="58228">
                        A third respondent stated that allowing an &ldquo;explanatory commentary&rdquo; section in either the solicitation or a

                        public website for agencies to explain the metric or means used to compile or report the types of equitable adjustments included or excluded from the metrics would be helpful.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-23" data-page="58229">
                        <em>Response:</em>
                         While primary data without context has value, the Councils acknowledge context could enhance the value of historical data in some situations and that agencies should have the opportunity to provide additional relevant information. The FAR text is revised to remove the proposed provision 52.236-XX, Notice Regarding Administration of Change Orders for Construction, and replace it with a requirement for contracting officers to transmit a notice on the GPE in the solicitation notice as required by FAR part 5 to meet the requirements of section 855 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/15/644" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15 U.S.C. 644(w)</a>). Additional text is added at FAR 5.205(h) to include the requirement for a solicitation notice on the GPE. Also, FAR 36.524 is replaced by FAR 36.211 to coincide with FAR 5.205(h) and to provide specifics on the information required in the solicitation notice (previously in the removed provision).
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-24" data-page="58229">As previously included in paragraph (b) of the removed provision, contracting officers will include in the notice a description of the agency's applicable policies and procedures or the address of an agency-specific, publicly accessible website containing the information that applies to definitization of equitable adjustments for change orders under construction contracts. Additionally, the final rule revises &ldquo;publicly accessible website&rdquo; from paragraph (b) of the now removed provision to &ldquo;an agency-specific, publicly accessible website&rdquo; at 36.211(b)(1) and (2) to allow more flexibility for agencies to share their specific guidance or to provide explanatory commentary.</p>
                    <p id="p-25" data-page="58229">Also, the proposed rule text at FAR 43.204(b)(3)(ii) regarding recording and maintaining data for definitizing requests for equitable adjustment is moved to FAR 43.204(b)(1)(ii) to clarify that the requirement applies to all change orders. This paragraph replaces in two places &ldquo;[website to be determined]&rdquo; with a reference to &ldquo;agency procedures&rdquo; to allow more flexibility in recording and maintaining the required data.</p>
                    <h4 id="h-17">3. Definitizing Equitable Adjustments</h4>
                    <h4 id="h-18">a. Equitable Adjustments in General Versus Unpriced Change Orders</h4>
                    <p id="p-26" data-page="58229">
                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent stated that it was unclear if the intent was to disclose all equitable adjustments in general or only those for unpriced change orders. The respondent stated that the rule should be limited to disclosing past performance data accounting for the time associated with definitization of equitable adjustments for unpriced change orders and not the time associated with the resolution of equitable adjustments in general. The respondent indicated section 855 discusses the definitization process but is not applicable to undefinitized equitable adjustments and stated that the FAR rule should be revised to clearly and precisely reflect the definitization process.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-27" data-page="58229">
                        <em>Response:</em>
                         This final rule implements section 855 of the John S. McCain NDAA for FY 2019, which requires notification to prospective bidders and offerors regarding administration of change orders for construction and does not exclude any type of change order. For clarification purposes, the final rule moves the proposed text at 43.204(b)(3)(ii) to 43.204(b)(1)(ii) to clarify that applicability is to all change orders.
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="h-19">b. Incorporate Broader Definition for Clarification</h4>
                    <p id="p-28" data-page="58229">
                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent stated that agencies have different standards for definitizing equitable adjustments and the FAR does not adequately define &ldquo;equitable adjustment;&rdquo; therefore, any resultant data reporting from Federal agencies will differ. The respondent stated that the rule should require agencies to incorporate the &ldquo;broadest possible definition&rdquo; in reporting the time to definitize an equitable adjustment. A second respondent stated that broadening the definition of a request for equitable adjustment to include contract modifications that result from either unilateral or bilateral changes would be helpful.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-29" data-page="58229">
                        <em>Response:</em>
                         FAR 43.204 and agency supplements provide the standard for definitizing equitable adjustments, while this rule adds the requirement for providing a notice to prospective bidders or offerors regarding definitization of change orders for construction. Also, the notice requirements at FAR 36.211(b)(1) (previously at FAR 36.524 and the removed provision) allows the agency issuing the solicitation to share the policies and procedures that apply to definitization of equitable adjustments for change orders under construction contracts. With this information all offerors will have the same understanding of each solicitation. A broader definition is not necessary considering the guidance that is already available in the FAR, agency supplements, and agency policies and procedures.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-30" data-page="58229">For clarification purposes, the final rule includes at FAR 43.204(b)(1)(ii) (previously at FAR 43.204(b)(3)(ii)) the parameter, per section 855 of the John S. McCain NDAA for FY 2019, that the measurement of definitizing equitable adjustments begins upon receipt of an adequate change order definitization proposal by the contracting officer and ends upon the contracting officer's execution of a contractual action to definitize the change order.</p>
                    <h4 id="h-20">c. Measurement of Change Order Process</h4>
                    <p id="p-31" data-page="58229">
                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent stated that measurement of the change order process should start when the contractor provides the contracting officer with an estimate of cost or provides schedule impacting decisions and the cost or changes are validated by the contracting officer as being within the scope of the contract.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-32" data-page="58229">
                        <em>Response:</em>
                         This FAR rule implements section 855 of the John S. McCain NDAA for FY 2019, which requires that measurement of the change order process begin upon receipt of a request for an equitable adjustment. For clarification purposes, the final rule identifies at FAR 43.204(b)(1)(ii) (previously at FAR 43.204(b)(3)(ii)) the measurement of the definitization of requests for equitable adjustment by including the following sentence, &ldquo;The definitization of an equitable adjustment begins upon receipt of an adequate change order definitization proposal by the contracting officer and ends upon the contracting officer's execution of a contractual action to definitize the change order.&rdquo;

                         One respondent stated that the transparency required by the FAR rule places undue costs and administrative burdens on agencies without corresponding benefits. The respondent also stated that by requiring disclosure of historical past performance data, the FAR rule will serve as a deterrent to some small business offerors and may cause small business offerors to inflate construction prices to mitigate possible lengthy equitable adjustment timeframes.

                         The FAR rule is not intended to place undue costs and administrative burden on agencies or to deter small business contractors. In contrast, the rule provides small business contractors with useful

                        information that will allow them to make informed decisions and to properly plan and prepare proposals, thus providing agencies with corresponding benefits. Also, the disclosure of an agency's historical past performance data on the timeliness of definitization of equitable adjustments will provide potential small business offerors with data that can be used in deciding whether to submit a proposal and the knowledge to plan financially for possible incurred costs if delays are experienced in the definitization of equitable adjustments. As with the initial contract, contracting officers are required to negotiate equitable adjustments resulting from change orders to ensure the Government receives fair and reasonable pricing. Therefore, the final rule is unchanged as a result of this comment.

                         The Government does not intend to develop a centralized tool to track the past performance data required under this rule. Instead, the final rule, at FAR 43.204(b)(1)(ii) (previously at FAR 43.204 (b)(3)(ii)), replaces &ldquo;[website to be determined]&rdquo; with &ldquo;follow agency procedures&rdquo; to clarify the recording and maintenance of data; and revises the next to last sentence of FAR 43.204(b)(1)(ii) to state, &ldquo;The contracting officer shall ensure the data is recorded promptly in accordance with agency procedures.&rdquo; Additionally, the data (previously required by the removed provision) to be disclosed to offerors is required in the table provided at FAR 36.211(b)(2).

The notice will provide potential small business offerors with information that may be useful to them as they prepare, or decide whether to prepare and submit, a proposal in response to an agency's solicitation for construction. For example, if an agency has a poor history of definitizing equitable adjustments, potential small business offerors may reconsider whether to submit a proposal in response to that agency's solicitation. Alternately, when preparing their proposals, small business offerors may consider the additional costs that could be incurred if they were to experience delays in the timely definitization of equitable adjustments. Additionally, contracting offices and contract administration offices are required to collect data on the time required to definitize change orders for construction contracts. There will be no cost impact to the public other than a de minimis cost to read the notice. The notice is for informational purposes and does not require any action on the part of the public.</p>

The FRFA is summarized as follows:</p>
                    
                        <p id="p-49" data-page="58231">This rule is necessary to implement section 855 of the John S.

Section 855 requires Federal agencies to provide a notice, along with solicitations for construction contracts anticipated to be awarded to small businesses, to prospective offerors regarding agency policies or practices in complying with FAR requirements related to the timely definitization of requests for equitable adjustment on construction contracts. The notice must also include data on the amount of time it took the agency to definitize requests for equitable adjustment on construction contracts during the three-year period preceding the issuance of the notice. FAR 36.211 requires agencies to furnish data for the three fiscal years preceding the issuance of the solicitation notice.</p>

The notice will provide potential small business offerors with information that may be useful to them as they prepare, or decide whether to prepare, and submit a proposal in response to an agency's solicitation for construction. For example, if an agency has a poor history of definitizing equitable adjustments, potential small business offerors may reconsider whether to submit a proposal in response to that agency's solicitation.

Of those, 1,797 were small entities. The number of construction contracts awarded in FY 2017, FY 2018, and FY 2019 averaged 4,349 per year, of which 3,323 were awarded to small entities. Additionally, during these same years, an average of 3,659 construction-related task orders were awarded each year to approximately 1,054 unique entities; 2,991 of those task orders were awarded to 838 small entities. On average, over FY 2017, FY 2018, and FY 2019, 6,422 modifications were issued each year to approximately 1,542 entities for change orders or definitization of change orders under construction contracts.
