                <p id="p-7" data-page="50635">
                    DoD published a proposed rule in the 
                    <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                     at <a href="/citation/80-FR-56939" class="fr-reference" data-reference="80 FR 56939">80 FR 56939</a> on September 21, 2015, to further implement section 818 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2012 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/112/public/81" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 112-81</a>), as modified by section 817 of the NDAA for FY 2015 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/113/public/291" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 113-291</a>).
                </p>
                <p id="p-8" data-page="50635">In accordance with section 818, this rule requires DoD contractors and subcontractors, except in limited circumstances, acquire electronic parts from trusted suppliers in order to further address the avoidance of counterfeit electronic parts. DoD contractors and subcontractors that are not the original component manufacturer are required by this rule to notify the contracting officer if it is not possible to obtain an electronic part from a trusted supplier. For those instances where the contractor obtains electronic parts from sources other than a trusted supplier, the contractor is responsible for inspection, test, and authentication in accordance with existing applicable industry standards.</p>
                <p id="p-9" data-page="50635">This rule enhances DoD's ability to strengthen the integrity of the process for acquisition of electronic parts and benefits both the Government and contractors. The careful selection of suppliers and the inspection, testing, and authentication of electronic parts that are not traceable to the original manufacturer are consistent with industry risk-based processes and are steps that a prudent contractor should take notwithstanding this rule. The avoidance of the proliferation of counterfeit electronic parts in the DoD supply chain reduces the risk of critical failure of fielded systems such as aircraft, ships, and other weapon systems, thus protecting troops' lives and safety.</p>
                <p id="p-10" data-page="50635">
                    This rule is part of DoD's retrospective plan, completed in August 2011, under <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">Executive Order 13563</a>, Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review. DoD's full plan and updates can be accessed at:

                <h4 id="h-13">a. Contractors Not Covered by Cost Accounting Standards</h4>
                <p id="p-32" data-page="50636">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     Several respondents objected to the application of this rule to contractors not subject to the cost accounting standards (CAS), noting that it will apply to small businesses and acquisitions of commercial items. One respondent stated that section 818(c)(3) of the NDAA for FY 2012 does not add contractor responsibilities for avoiding counterfeit electronic parts to other than CAS-covered contractors and that DoD is overstepping Congressional intent when it applies this rule to small businesses and contracts for commercial items. The respondent states that section 818(c)(2) is only directed to contracts subject to CAS.
                </p>
                <p id="p-33" data-page="50636">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     Section 818 defines &ldquo;covered contractors&rdquo; to mean the same as the definition of the term in section 893(f)(2) of the NDAA for FY 2011, 
                    <em>i.e.</em>, a contractor that is subject to CAS under section 26 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/422" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 422</a>). Some portions of section 818 address covered contractors (
                    <em>e.g.</em>, paragraph (c)(2)), and therefore only apply to contractors subject to CAS. However, paragraph (c)(3) of section 818 does not use the term &ldquo;covered contractor.&rdquo; It applies to all DoD contractors and subcontractors when obtaining electronic parts to be provided to DoD under a DoD contract. Section 818 is clear that DoD contractors and subcontractors at all tiers are responsible for detecting and avoiding counterfeit electronic parts. Thus, 252.246-7008 is consistent with the statute.

                <p id="p-34" data-page="50636">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     Another respondent stated the opinion that small entities not subject to CAS comprise a large portion of the counterfeit parts that directly threaten the DoD supply chain. The respondent provided several examples of non-CAS covered entities that were found by the Government to have allowed counterfeit parts to enter the DoD supply chain.

One respondent expressed specific concern that the proposed expansion of coverage to commercial item contractors could result in reduced sources and increased costs for contractors. Another respondent stated that manufacturers of COTS items are independently motivated by the commercial market to assure that their products function as advertised.

                     Several respondents expressed concerns that the proposed rule does not address the dilemma industry continually faces concerning the general lack of acceptance of counterfeit part prevention requirements flowdown by COTS electronic assembly producers and their authorized dealers. One respondent suggested providing relief from the obligation to flow down to COTS electronic assembly manufacturers.

                    <em>Response:</em>
                     DoD has modified paragraph (b)(3) of the clause 252.246-7008 in the final rule to specify the required contractor actions if a subcontractor refuses to accept flowdown of the clause, to include notification to the contracting officer; contractor inspection, testing, and authentication of the part; and the requirement to make documentation of such inspection, testing, and authentication available to the Government upon request.

                <p id="p-41" data-page="50636">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     Several respondents expressed concerns that mandatory subcontract flowdown in 252.246-7008(e) for commercial items is inconsistent with Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act and that commercial item subcontracts or supplier agreements should be exempted. Another respondent stated that application of unique defense rules to commercial items where not expressly directed in the statute are prohibited without a best interests determination per <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2377" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2377</a>. According to the respondent, in lieu of such a determination, at several points in the supplementary information, it states that &ldquo;DoD intends to determine that it is in the best interests to apply the rule to . . . .&rdquo; The respondent finds it unclear what the Department means by using the word &ldquo;intends&rdquo; rather than making the required determination or putting the cost-benefit analysis right in the rulemaking for review by the public.

                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The flowdown to subcontracts for commercial items is not in conflict with DFARS clause 252.244-7000, Subcontracts for Commercial Items. DFARS 252.244-7000 states that the contractor is not required to flow down the terms of any DFARS clause in a subcontract for commercial items unless so specified in the particular clause. The fact that the new clause in this rule (252.246-7008), as well as the preexisting clause 252.246-7007, specify such flowdown to subcontracts for commercial items that are for electronic parts or assemblies containing electronic parts is, therefore, in conformance with DFARS 252.244-7000.

                     Several respondents recommended revising the clause to make it clear that the flowdown does not apply to the original manufacturers. Several respondents asserted that the flowdown to original manufacturers would be costly to both the manufacturer and the end customer and unnecessary. One respondent stated that as an authorized dealer they would not be able to flow down the requirements to the original equipment manufacturers they represent; they have distribution agreements with them that dictate by contract what each parties' responsibilities are. Another respondent suggested it would also limit the genuine products available to the Government to purchase.

                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     One respondent commented that the proposed rule would impose a substantial burden on manufacturers of COTS medical devices and is unnecessary to resolve concerns that may present a significant mission, security, or safety hazard. This is especially true for medical devices, which are heavily regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and often contain one or more electronic parts. According to the respondent, DoD's application of the rule to all contractors would apply new requirements to a sizeable group of products that already have a highly effective means of addressing the concern of counterfeit electronic parts.
                </p>
                <p id="p-53" data-page="50637">Furthermore, the respondent commented that the FDA is the Federal agency tasked with protecting the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, quality and security of drugs, vaccines, and other biological product and medical devices. The respondent considered that this will not only unduly increase the burden on manufacturers; it has the capacity to cause confusion in the marketplace and result in potential adverse implications for public health. The FDA is in the best position to strike the proper balance of interests in the health care system when establishing requirements for assuring the quality of the products it regulates, assessing the burdens these requirements place on manufacturers, and considering their impact on healthcare costs and healthcare innovation. FDA already regulates purchasing controls for medical device manufacturing, requiring each manufacturer to ensure that all purchases or otherwise received product and services conform to the specified requirements. Medical device manufacturers are required to have robust processes in place to review, investigate, and evaluate external manufacturers and suppliers. The respondent recommended that any additional requirements for FDA-regulated products should be made through the current governing agency, the FDA.</p>

                    <em>Response:</em>
                     This rule implements section 818 of the NDAA for FY 2012, as amended by section 817 of the NDAA for FY 2015, and prescribes the policy and procedures for preventing counterfeit electronic parts from entering the supply chain. This rule addresses concerns that DoD has encountered regarding the electronic parts, including those that are COTS items, and including medical devices. DoD recognizes the FDA's authority over drugs and medical devices. DoD recognizes that manufacturers are required to have processes in place to review, investigate, and evaluate external manufacturers and suppliers. However, DoD has a responsibility to protect the warfighter by ensuring that we are utilizing electronic products that are not counterfeit or contain counterfeit parts.

For reference, the other usage of trusted supplier is with the Trusted Access Program Office (TAPO), which accredits trusted foundries and suppliers through the Defense Microelectronics Activity. One respondent stated that the clause should not mention trusted suppliers at all, instead completely listing items (1) through (3) in the definition, whenever applicable.

                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The phrase &ldquo;trusted supplier&rdquo; has been mentioned as a source of confusion since it is was first used in the NDAA for FY 2012 (section 818). The final rule published under DFARS Case 2012-D055, Detection and Avoidance of Counterfeit Parts, avoided use of the term &ldquo;trusted supplier.&rdquo; The proposed rule under this case introduced the term because it is the term consistently used in section 818 of the NDAA for FY 2012, and subsequent amendments to that statute.

This term reflects that this is a supplier that is not authorized to sell the manufacturer's product, but the contractor has assessed and approved this supplier.</p>

Several respondents disagreed with item (4) in the definition, which allows contractor-approved unauthorized distributors to be a trusted supplier. One respondent went further by claiming that item (3), unauthorized distributors who bought exclusively from the original component manufacturer or an authorized distributor, also should not be included in the definition. One respondent stated that the definition should contain an &ldquo;or&rdquo; statement that requires purchase from (1) manufacturer or (2) authorized distributor supplier types before (3) and (4) unauthorized distributors of any sort could be used. Another respondent echoed this sentiment without specifically requesting the change in definition. One respondent stated that the definition should be clarified to be consistent throughout the clause.

                     One respondent recommended amending the definition of &ldquo;contract electronics manufacturer&rdquo; to be in line with industry use of the term. According to the respondent, industry understands a contract electronics manufacturer to be a company who builds boards or units for another company, whereas the fabrication of an electronic part &ldquo;under a contract with, or with express written authority of, the original manufacturer&rdquo; is the work of an authorized aftermarket manufacturer. According to the respondent, this definition aligns with the industry standards AS5553, AS6171, and AS6081.

                <p id="p-71" data-page="50638">The respondent therefore recommended the following definition: &ldquo;Contract electronics manufacturer&rdquo; means an organization that produces goods, using electronic parts, for other companies on a contract basis under the label or brand name of the other organization.</p>

                <p id="p-74" data-page="50639">DoD also removed the term &ldquo;electronics&rdquo; from the defined term, because the other related terms of &ldquo;original manufacturer,&rdquo; original component manufacturer,&rdquo; and &ldquo;original equipment manufacturer&rdquo; are not limited to just electronic parts, even though this rule then applies those terms to the acquisition of electronic parts.

                     One respondent recommended that DoD define the supply base in the same way as the commercial defense industry and regulate sources of supply accordingly. According to the respondent, DoD defines the supply base in terms of (1) original equipment manufacturer primes; (2) manufacturers; and (3) dealers, distributors, or others; while the commercial defense industry uses the terms (1) original equipment manufacturer primes; (2) approved manufacturers; (3) authorized dealers/distributors; (4) dealers/brokers/others; and (5) surplus dealers.

                     &ldquo;legally authorized sources&rdquo;). According to the respondent, purchasing from any other source significantly increases the likelihood of acquiring counterfeit parts.

                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     Several respondents requested that DoD clarify terms &ldquo;in stock&rdquo; and &ldquo;available in stock.&rdquo; One respondent noted that a part could be in production but not in stock, or not in production but available in stock. This respondent expressed concerns about the costly steps necessary to ensure compliance when a part is not acquired from a trusted supplier, so the initial analysis of the supply chain sources could be relevant to how a contractor acquires a specific part and have many assorted cost impacts. Another respondent had concerns with use of the phrase &ldquo;currently available in stock&rdquo; as it raises questions about parts that are in production but have lead times. &ldquo;Unless there is a demonstrated, immediate need for a part in production with a lead time, contractors should not have the option to seek the part from a source with a higher level of counterfeit risk.&rdquo; That respondent also had concerns with the use of the phrase &ldquo;parts that are not in production&rdquo; raising issues about obsolete parts that are not in production by the original manufacturer but may be produced on demand in a timely manner by authorized aftermarket manufacturers.
                </p>
                <p id="p-88" data-page="50639">One respondent recommended that DoD must require contractors to do a more exhaustive search of the authorized supply channel before utilizing other sources. This respondent also recommended that the rule should clarify that &ldquo;not currently available in stock&rdquo; means &ldquo;not currently available in stock from original manufacturer, authorized aftermarket manufacturers, or authorized dealers.&rdquo;</p>
                <p id="p-89" data-page="50639">One respondent thought of numerous possibilities of the meaning of &ldquo;unavailable&rdquo;:</p>

                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The statute requires that if parts are in production or currently available in stock, the contractor or subcontractor must use a Category 1 supplier. The electronic parts may be in production and currently available in stock, in production and not currently available in stock, or not in production but currently available in stock. Therefore, even if there is a demonstrated, immediate need for a part in production with a lead time, contractors do not have the option to seek the part from other than a Category 1 source. Some of the listed technicalities with regard to potential meanings of &ldquo;unavailable&rdquo; are irrelevant, because if the part is in production, it must be bought from a Category 1 supplier, whether or not it is currently available or unavailable in stock.
                </p>
                <p id="p-97" data-page="50640">DoD has modified the final rule to clarify that &ldquo;in production&rdquo; includes by the original manufacturer or by an authorized aftermarket manufacturer, and that &ldquo;currently available in stock&rdquo; means from one of the Category 1 sources.</p>
                <p id="p-98" data-page="50640">In addition, DoD changed &ldquo;or&rdquo; to &ldquo;and&rdquo; in DFARS 246.870-2(a)(1)(ii) and at 252.246-7008(b)(2) because &ldquo;or&rdquo; includes circumstances that overlap with paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (b)(1), respectively, and does not accurately reflect the statutory requirement to specify the sources in circumstances not covered in those paragraphs. The only remaining circumstance to be covered in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) and (b)(2) is &ldquo;not in production&rdquo; and &ldquo;not currently available in stock.&rdquo;</p>
                <p id="p-99" data-page="50640">A contractor must make a good faith effort to determine whether an electronic part is available from Category 1 sources (DFARS 246.870-2(a)(1)(i)). Any changes to a contractor's use of approved sources would require additional review by DoD. Due to the added costs that may be involved in obtaining a part from a contractor-approved supplier, a contractor is incentivized to locate a Category 1 source.</p>
                <p id="p-100" data-page="50640">This DFARS rule does not address obsolescence management and diminishing manufacturing sources as these areas are outside the scope of this case. DFARS Case 2016-D022 will implement section 803 of the NDAA for FY 2014 to address these issues. This rule takes a risk-based approach to counterfeit prevention. The rule allows contractors to make risk-based decisions (such as testing and inspection) based on supply chain assurance measures (such as the source of the electronic part), which is all subject to review and audit by the contracting officer. DoD uses the Department of Defense Risk, Issue, and Opportunity Management Guide for Defense Acquisition Programs.</p>

                     Several respondents recommended that the proposed rule be revised to eliminate redundant validation of suppliers. The respondents assert that the rule as written would require contractors to validate U.S. Government sources such as the Defense Logistics Agency and the Federal Supply Schedule as trusted suppliers. Several respondents recommend specifying that these sources be considered trusted suppliers. Another respondent recommended presuming suppliers to be &ldquo;trusted&rdquo; if the prime and subcontractors have approved processes in place to identify suppliers and provide proof that those processes have been followed. Alternately, this respondent suggested that the Government could work with industry to develop a third party accreditation program to verify that suppliers at all tiers are in compliance with established counterfeit detection and avoidance requirements and identify a pool of accredited suppliers.

According to one respondent, there will be increased costs associated with implementation and recordkeeping, which could be significant for smaller businesses. One respondent noted that traceability does not necessarily prove that an electronic component is genuine or that the component has been properly packaged, stored or handled in accordance with the original component manufacturer's specifications and that traceability documents and technologies are subject to counterfeiting.

                    <em>Response:</em>
                     First, the requirement in DFARS 252.246-7007, Contractor Counterfeit Electronic Part Detection and Avoidance System, states in paragraph (c)(4) that the system shall address risk-based processes that enable tracking of electronic parts from the original manufacturer to product acceptance by the Government. Then in paragraph (c) of DFARS 252.246-7008, it again states that the contractor shall have risk-based processes (taking into consideration the consequences of failure of an electronic part) that enable tracking from the original manufacturer. The level of inspection, testing, and authentication that the contractor would perform if unable to track an electronic part from the original manufacturer would also be commensurate with the criticality of the part. The final rule removes the requirement for contractor consideration of alternative parts. That should be a Government decision.

                     One respondent asked for clarification that the costs associated with any new supply chain security measures are allowable. According to the respondent, the rule is silent as to who will bear the added costs of implementing serialized traceability or of the non-recurring engineering associated with utilizing alternate parts or of the testing necessary to establish authenticity.

                <p id="p-161" data-page="50643">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The implementation costs associated with compliance with DFARS 252.246-7008 are not unlike any other costs anticipated to be incurred by the contractor or subcontractor to perform the requirements of a contract. Whether a cost is allowable and allocable is generally governed by FAR part 31. Unless a cost is explicitly unallowable, whether a cost is allowable depends on factors such as reasonableness, allocability, CAS standards (and approved disclosure statements), if applicable, otherwise, generally accepted accounting principles and practices appropriate to the particular circumstances, and the terms of the contract. It is unnecessary to address the allowability of costs incurred under every contract requirement. In accordance with FAR 31.201-4, a cost is allocable if it is assignable or chargeable to one or more cost objectives on the basis of relative benefits received or other equitable relationship. Subject to these conditions a cost is allocable to a Government contract if it is (a) incurred specifically for the contract; (b) benefits both the contract and other work, and can be distributed to them in reasonable proportion to the benefits received; or (c) is necessary to the overall operation of the business, although a direct relationship to any particular cost objective cannot be shown.

                <p id="p-165" data-page="50644">The respondent also believed that DoD may already have access to a lot of this data, because DoD has access to databases of thousands of suppliers that provide parts to its acquisition system.

                     The estimated information collection burden in the proposed rule related only to the required notification when using other than a &ldquo;trusted supplier.&rdquo; This should be quite rare, since it only occurs when an item is out of production, not currently available in stock, and not available from a contractor-approved supplier. However, the estimates have been adjusted to acknowledge that in many cases information for such notification may have to be provided by a lower tier subcontractor to the prime contractor.

                     DoD has not been able to identify a viable alternative that would meet the objectives of the rule and comply with the statutory requirements. The notification requirement is statutory. The data on traceability or inspection, testing, and validation need only be provided to the Government upon request.

Counterfeit electronic parts, regardless of dollar value, can seriously disrupt the DoD supply chain, harm weapon system integrity, and endanger troops' lives. Even low dollar value electronic parts can cause critical failure of fielded systems, such as aircraft, ships, and other weapon systems. Furthermore, studies have shown that a large proportion of proven counterfeit electronic parts were initially purchased as commercial items, including COTS items. Therefore, exempting contracts and subcontracts below the SAT or for acquisition of commercial (including COTS) items from application of the statute would severely decrease the intended effect of the statute and increase the risk of receiving counterfeit parts, which may present a significant mission, security, or safety hazard.</p>

                    the DFARS requirement for obtaining electronic parts from trusted sources may deter some small businesses and even suppliers of commercial items and COTS (where the Government is not a major portion of sales). However, the receipt of counterfeit parts represents an unacceptable risk to the Government. The clause requires small businesses and commercial item suppliers to put in place risk-based processes that take into consideration the consequences of failure.

                     The Office of Advocacy stated that the cost of compliance will serve to deter small businesses from participating as prime and subcontractors in the Federal Acquisition process. More specifically, the Office of Advocacy, found it unclear, for parts that are in production, who will absorb the higher costs of restrictions on sources of electronic parts. The Office of Advocacy stated that this was of concern to small businesses. For parts that are not in production, the Office of Advocacy found it unclear how the small business owner is to provide documentation to the prime contractor or the contracting officer whether the part is in production or not. The Office of Advocacy also cites lack of guidance on cost or process or acceptable procedures for the small business to follow.

                     The Government recognizes that the cost of compliance to the DFARS requirement for obtaining electronic parts from trusted sources may deter some small businesses and even suppliers of commercial items and COTS (where the Government is not a major portion of sales). However, the receipt of counterfeit parts represents an unacceptable risk to the Government. With regard to cost allowability, the implementation costs associated with compliance with DFARS 252.246-7008 are not unlike any other costs anticipated to be incurred by the contractor or subcontractor to perform the requirements of a contract (see section II.B.10. of this preamble). With regard to the costs of counterfeit electronic parts and suspect counterfeit electronic parts, and the cost of rework or corrective action that may be required to remedy the use or inclusion of such parts, section 818(c)(2)(B), as amended by the section 885 of the NDAA for FY 2016, will make such costs allowable if the contractor obtains such parts in accordance with the regulations to be published under this case; discovers the counterfeit parts or suspect counterfeit parts; and provides timely notice to the Government (see DFARS Case 2016-D010).

                <p id="p-198" data-page="50646">With regard to parts that are not in production, the final rule has added clarification about necessary recordkeeping and documentation that shall be provided upon request (by the next high tier for a subcontractor or by the Government for the prime contractor). There is no requirement to provide documentation of whether the part is in productions. If the part can be obtained from a contractor-approved supplier and the contractor can establish traceability to the original manufacturer, then there is only need to provide documentation of the traceability upon request. If traceability cannot be established, then the contractor is required to maintain documentation of the required inspection, testing, and authentication, and make such documentation available upon request (see DFARS 252.246-7008(b)(3)(ii) and (c)(3)).</p>

The Office of Advocacy questioned whether COTS small businesses were included in the estimates.

                     DoD has revised the estimated number of small business entities affected by the rule from 33,000 to 52,168. The supporting statement for the information collection requirement in the proposed rule only addressed the burden associated with the notification if the contractor is using a source other than a &ldquo;trusted supplier.&rdquo; The final rule makes explicit the requirement to maintain documentation with regard to traceability or inspection, testing, and authentication and make it available upon request (see section II.B.12. of this preamble). This is not an added burden for contractors and subcontractors but an acknowledgement of a burden that was implicit in the proposed rule.

                    The detection and avoidance of counterfeit parts is too important to delay implementation. A low dollar value undetected counterfeit part from a small business or a COTS item can have equally disastrous consequences as

                    higher dollar value part that is not a COTS item or provided by a small business. Not only is this a requirement of the law, but the criticality of levying this requirements on all vendors is to meet operational mission requirements and prevent loss of life. However, the final rule has been revised to provide a procedure for notification, inspection, testing, and authentication of an electronic part if a subcontractor refuses to accept flowdown of the clause at DFARS 252.246-7008.

                <p id="p-211" data-page="50647">Based on Federal Procurement Data System data for FY 2015, DoD estimates that this rule will apply to approximately 52,168 small entities that have DoD prime contracts or subcontracts for electronic parts, including end items, components, parts, or assemblies containing electronic parts; or services, if the contractor will supply electronic parts or components, parts, or assemblies containing electronic parts as part of the service.</p>
                <p id="p-212" data-page="50647">In addition to the requirements to acquire electronic components from trusted suppliers (in the rule: Original manufacturers, authorized suppliers, suppliers that obtain parts exclusively from original manufacturers or authorized suppliers, and contractor-approved suppliers), contractors and subcontractors that are not the original manufacturer or authorized supplier are required have a risk-based process to trace electronic parts from the original manufacturer to product acceptance by the Government. If that is not feasible, the Contractor shall have a process to complete an evaluation that includes consideration of alternative parts or utilization of tests and inspections commensurate with the risk. If it is not possible to obtain an electronic part from a trusted supplier, the contractor is required to notify the contracting officer. The contractor is responsible for inspection, testing, and authentication, in accordance with existing applicable industry standards, of electronic parts obtained from sources other than a trusted supplier. Notifying the contracting officer if it is not possible to obtain an electronic part from a trusted supplier, or responding to requests for documentation on traceability or inspection, testing, and validation of electronic parts would probably involve a mid-level of executive involvement.

It is not possible to exempt small entities or acquisition of commercial items (including COTS items) from application of this rule or phase in the applicability to such entities, without an unacceptable increase in the risk to of counterfeit parts in the supply chain. (See response to the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration comments on alternatives in this FRFA.) DoD also considered (with the addition of this DFARS clause 252.246-7008, which is applicable to all subcontractors that provide electronic parts, including small businesses) whether the requirements of DFARS 252.247-7007 for a formal system to detect and avoid counterfeit parts could be made inapplicable to small businesses that are subcontractors to a CAS-covered prime contractor. This alternative was not acceptable to DoD policy experts.</p>
