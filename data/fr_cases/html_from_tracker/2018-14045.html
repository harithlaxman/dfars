                    <h4 id="h-11">1. Definition of &ldquo;direct offsets&rdquo;</h4>
                    <p id="p-14" data-page="30826">
                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         The respondent stated that the definition of &ldquo;direct offsets&rdquo; in the proposed rule is too broad to satisfy the statutory requirements, and leaves room for ambiguity in determining whether an offset requirement is indirect or direct. In some cases, there may be indirect offset projects that are related to the item being purchased, but not part of the FMS procurement itself, such as a maintenance facility for the item that is being offered. The definition for direct offsets should be limited to manufacturing or services performed by a foreign supplier to fulfill the specific FMS contract deliverable. For example, the respondent explained that FMS customers are increasingly interested in maintaining their aircraft throughout the lifecycle and are requesting projects from U.S. aerospace companies that involve maintenance, repair, overhaul, and simulation capability. Related products and services that are needed to operate, maintain, and/or sustain the item, but are not part of the scope or directly procured under the LOA, including training and maintenance activities, are not direct offsets.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-15" data-page="30826">Moreover, although it is correct that direct offsets are &ldquo;generally . . . performed within a specific period,&rdquo; this is not necessarily a distinguishing characteristic for a direct offset, and may lead to confusion. The respondent, however, recommended adding the clarifying phrase &ldquo;integral to the deliverable of the FMS contract&rdquo; in the definition, because it reinforces that direct offsets are directly related to the system offered in the LOA.</p>
                    <p id="p-16" data-page="30826">
                        <em>Response:</em>
                         DoD concurs with the respondent's recommendation in part. The first sentence of the direct offset definition is revised to provide that a direct offset involves benefits or obligations, including supplies or services, that are directly related to the item being purchased and are integral to the deliverable of the FMS contract. However, the definition still states that, generally, direct offsets must be performed within a specific period, because they are integral to the deliverable of the FMS contract, to provide a bright line discriminator between direct and indirect offsets.
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="h-12">2. Definition of &ldquo;indirect offsets&rdquo;</h4>
                    <p id="p-17" data-page="30826">
                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         The respondent recommended revising the definition of &ldquo;indirect offsets&rdquo; to provide clarity for the contracting officers to identify indirect offsets and enable FMS customers to obtain the offset benefits they need without the additional cost and time of having the contractor propose and negotiate an offset program subject to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) parts 15 and 31, thereby fulfilling the intention of section 812 of the NDAA for FY 2016. Foreign customers are increasingly looking for indirect offset projects that are not integral to the items being purchased in an LOA, but that may be related to the defense articles. Without revision to this definition, contracting officers could mistakenly view these indirect offset projects as direct offsets. In addition, offsets are not necessarily in fulfillment of an FMS contract. Since offsets are executed under a separate offset agreement, the offset customer is not always the same as the supply contract customer, and the offset authority may have different offset project priorities than the supply contract customer.

                    <p id="p-19" data-page="30826">
                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         The respondent recommended revising the definition of &ldquo;offset costs.&rdquo; Generally, offsets are implemented in accordance with a foreign purchaser's national offset requirements. These requirements can differ from country to country, and not all offset transactions may be deemed to be required. Offsets are frequently agreed to in a contractual commitment and are not addressed explicitly in the LOA. Accordingly, the definition of offset costs should be modified to address these circumstances.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-20" data-page="30826">
                        <em>Response:</em>
                         DoD disagrees with this recommendation. For offsets to be included in FMS contracts, they must be required (explicitly or implicitly) as a condition of foreign military sales.

                    <p id="p-21" data-page="30826">
                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         The respondent recommended removing the word &ldquo;Agreements&rdquo; from the title for DFARS clause 252.215-7014. The distinction between direct and indirect offsets is typically made at the project level, not at the agreement level. An FMS customer may include requirements for both direct and indirect projects in a single offset agreement. A reference here to an Agreement is overbroad and is certain to cause confusion in the implementation.

                    <p id="p-23" data-page="30826">
                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         The respondent believes that the administrative requirement for evidence to show that the FMS customer has &ldquo;made the provision of an indirect offset a condition of the FMS acquisition&rdquo; and that such evidence support the specific acquisition is unnecessary, onerous, and not responsive to statutory guidance provided in section 812 of the NDAA for FY 2016.

                        The respondent concurs with prior public comments to the interim rule which stated that, &ldquo;a country's offset guidelines may allow for both direct and indirect projects, but the defense contractor and foreign government might not decide on a specific mix of

                        direct versus indirect projects until after the LOA is signed. As such, this requirement could effectively negate much of the benefit of this rule.&rdquo;
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-25" data-page="30827">The respondent explained that in practice, an offset agreement may not specify an indirect offset requirement, but rather the overall offset obligation that can be fulfilled with both direct and indirect offset projects. Moreover, many offset agreements do not require offset obligation percentages or minimum direct/indirect offset requirements. A country's offset requirements may also flow down to items (products or services) that are affiliated with sales that are being supplied by, but not limited to, Government-furnished equipment, or lower tier defense contractors. In such cases, a contractor may have no &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; to provide of the requirement related to the specific acquisition other than the requirements outlined in the foreign law, regulation, policy, or other general guidance.</p>
                    <p id="p-26" data-page="30827">The intent of section 812 of the NDAA for FY 2016 was to eliminate the need for an unnecessary and time-consuming review of offsets that are negotiated directly between the contractor and foreign customer. A combination of the &ldquo;FMS customer's offset guidelines, requirements, regulations or law, policy or historical requirements&rdquo; should be a sufficient showing of evidence for an offset requirement.</p>
                    <p id="p-27" data-page="30827">The respondent recommended that contracting officers accept that the contractor has an indirect offset requirement, if so stated, since a contractor claiming an offset requirement where none exists would be subject to other laws and regulations governing such false claims.</p>
                    <p id="p-28" data-page="30827">
                        <em>Response:</em>
                         It is not an unreasonable requirement for contractors to provide the contracting officer a signed offset agreement or other documentation showing that the FMS customer has made the provision of an indirect offset a condition of the FMS acquisition as a condition for deeming indirect offset costs to be reasonable for purposes of FAR parts 15 and 31 with no further analysis necessary. Therefore, no revisions are necessary.

                    <h4 id="h-16">6. Administrative Costs</h4>
                    <p id="p-29" data-page="30827">
                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         The respondent believed that administration costs should not be distinguishable from other indirect costs for the purposes of this rule. As stated, &ldquo;indirect offset costs are deemed reasonable for purposes of FAR parts 15 and 31 with no further analysis necessary on the part of the contracting officer. . . .&rdquo; Similarly, section 812 of the NDAA for FY 2016 makes no such distinction between indirect offset administration costs and other costs.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-30" data-page="30827">The respondent further stated that it is unclear what administration costs might be envisioned for further review. For example, travel and project execution costs might be deemed administrative costs. Since these costs would not be determined until the offset projects are defined, such costs might also not be determined until after the LOA is signed.</p>
                    <p id="p-31" data-page="30827">The respondent explained that the intent of the statutory and regulatory guidance related to indirect offset costs was to ensure that contracting officers did not have to conduct reasonableness analysis in these instances. Contracting officers should not have a greater requirement to parse out indirect administration costs for which they have no greater knowledge and expertise than the indirect offset costs in total.</p>
                    <p id="p-32" data-page="30827">The respondent suggested that the definitions for &ldquo;direct&rdquo; and &ldquo;indirect&rdquo; offsets should provide sufficient clarification for contracting officers to ensure that the final rule implements the statutory requirement that those costs not directly related to the system or item being purchased under the LOA are not subjected to certified pricing requirements.</p>
                    <p id="p-33" data-page="30827">Therefore, the respondent believed that it is not appropriate or necessary for a contracting officer to engage in cost reasonableness analysis for administration costs related to indirect offsets. The respondent recommended that the final rule should make clear that all indirect offset costs are deemed reasonable for the purposes of FAR parts 15 and 31 with no further analysis necessary on the part of the contracting officer, and that the rule applies to all indirect offset costs, including any administrative costs.</p>
                    <p id="p-34" data-page="30827">
                        <em>Response:</em>
                         The definitions for &ldquo;direct&rdquo; and &ldquo;indirect&rdquo; offsets provides sufficient clarification for contracting officers to ensure that those costs not directly related to the item being purchased or integral to the deliverable of the FMS contract are not subjected to certified pricing requirements. No further clarification is required.

                    <p id="p-38" data-page="30827">A final regulatory flexibility analysis has been performed and is summarized as follows:</p>
                    <p id="p-39" data-page="30827">The objective of this rule is to incorporate the requirements of section 812 of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2016 to provide clarification to contracting officers when indirect offsets are a condition of an FMS acquisition. This rule revises DFARS 225.7303-2, &ldquo;Cost of doing business with a foreign government or an international organization&rdquo; by adding paragraph (a)(3)(iii) to provide guidelines to contracting officers when an indirect offset is a condition of a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) acquisition. This rule specifically addresses indirect offsets as they are applied to the Defense Security Cooperation Agency's FMS cases. This rule is necessitated by the recent and foreseeable trend of increasing numbers and complexity of indirect offsets desired by DoD FMS customers.</p>

                        DoD administers FMS programs with partner nations to maintain and strengthen relationships with nations that if not nurtured through these partnerships may threaten national security. The Department's FMS program allows foreign customers to request, and pay for, through inclusion of the cost in the FMS Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) and DoD contract, offsets that are directly related

                        to the FMS end items (
                        <em>i.e.,</em>
                         &ldquo;direct offsets&rdquo;), as well as offsets that are not directly related to the end item (
                        <em>i.e.,</em>
                         &ldquo;indirect offsets&rdquo;).
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-41" data-page="30828">DoD recognizes the need to have offsets embedded in DoD FMS contracts. However, the decision whether to engage in indirect offsets, and the responsibility for negotiating and implementing these offset arrangements, ultimately reside with the FMS customer and contractor(s) involved. Thus, the DoD contracting officer is not provided the information necessary to negotiate cost or price of the indirect offsets, particularly with respect to price reasonableness determinations pursuant to FAR part 15. This rule provides that under these circumstances, when the provision of an indirect offset is a condition of the FMS acquisition and provided that the U.S. defense contractor submits to the contracting officer an offset agreement or other substantiating documentation, those indirect offset costs are deemed reasonable for the purposes of FAR part 31.</p>
                    <p id="p-42" data-page="30828">There were no significant issues raised by the public in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis.</p>
                    <p id="p-43" data-page="30828">DoD does not expect this rule to have a significant impact on the small businesses that may be affected by this rule, because the DFARS amendments merely clarify that contracting officers are not responsible for making a determination of price reasonableness for indirect offset agreements for which they have no purview.</p>

                        DoD does not expect this rule to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>,

                                <em>Offset</em>
                                 means a benefit or obligation agreed to by a contractor and a foreign government or international organization as an inducement or condition to purchase supplies or services pursuant to a foreign military sale (FMS). There are two types of offsets: Direct offsets and indirect offsets.
                            </p>
                            <p id="p-51" data-page="30828">(1) A direct offset involves benefits or obligations, including supplies or services that are directly related to the item(s) being purchased and are integral to the deliverable of the FMS contract. For example, as a condition of a foreign military sale, the contractor may require or agree to permit the customer to produce in its country certain components or subsystems of the item being sold. Generally, direct offsets must be performed within a specified period, because they are integral to the deliverable of the FMS contract.</p>

For example, as a condition of a foreign military sale, the contractor may agree to purchase certain manufactured products, agricultural commodities, raw materials, or services, or make an equity investment or grant of equipment required by the FMS customer, or may agree to build a school, road or other facility. Indirect offsets would also include projects that are related to the FMS contract but not purchased under said contract (

                                 a project to develop or advance a capability, technology transfer, or know-how in a foreign company). Indirect offsets may be accomplished without a clearly defined period of performance.

                                     means a benefit or obligation agreed to by a contractor and a foreign government or international organization as an inducement or condition to purchase supplies or services pursuant to a foreign military sale (FMS). There are two types of offsets: Direct offsets and indirect offsets.

                                <p id="p-68" data-page="30829">(i) A direct offset involves benefits or obligations, including supplies or services that are directly related to the item being purchased and are integral to the deliverable of the FMS contract. For example, as a condition of a foreign military sale, the contractor may require or agree to permit the customer to produce in its country certain components or subsystems of the item being sold. Generally, direct offsets must be performed within a specified period, because they are integral to the deliverable of the FMS contract.</p>

For example, as a condition of a foreign military sale, the contractor may agree to purchase certain manufactured products, agricultural commodities, raw materials, or services, or make an equity investment or grant of equipment required by the FMS customer, or may agree to build a school, road or other facility. Indirect offsets would also include projects that are related to the FMS contract but not purchased under said contract (
