                    <p id="p-6" data-page="24895"></p>
                    <h2 id="h-7">I. Background</h2>
                    <p id="p-7" data-page="24895">DoD is amending the DFARS to implement sections 217(a) and 821 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/114/public/328" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 114-328</a>). Section 821 increases the micro-purchase threshold for the Department of Defense procurements to $5,000. Section 217(a) further increases the micro-purchase threshold to $10,000 for purposes of DoD basic research programs and for the activities of the DoD science and technology reinvention laboratories. Accordingly, DFARS section 202.101, Definitions, is amended to add a new micro-purchase threshold definition as it relates to DoD procurements, to be used in lieu of the definition in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). To align with the addition of the new DoD micro-purchase definition, a cross-reference to the definition at FAR 2.101 is revised in DFARS clause 252.232-7009, Mandatory Payments by Governmentwide Commercial Purchase Card.</p>
                    <h2 id="h-8">II. Applicability to Contracts at or Below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT) and for Commercial Items, Including Commercially Available Off-the-Shelf (COTS) Items</h2>
                    <p id="p-8" data-page="24895">This rule amends DFARS 202.101 to add an alternate definition for &ldquo;micro-purchase threshold&rdquo; in lieu of the definition of &ldquo;micro-purchase threshold&rdquo; at FAR 2.101. This rule simply clarifies the application of the micro-purchase threshold as it relates to DoD procurements, and does not apply additional requirements to contracts at or below the SAT or for the acquisition of commercial items, including COTS items.</p>
                    <h2 id="h-9">III. Publication of This Final Rule for Public Comment Is Not Required by Statute</h2>
                    <p id="p-9" data-page="24895">The statute that applies to the publication of the FAR is the Office of Federal Procurement Policy statute (codified at title 41 of the United States Code). Specifically, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1707" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1707(a)(1)</a> requires that a procurement policy, regulation, procedure or form (including an amendment or modification thereof) must be published for public comment if it relates to the expenditure of appropriated funds, and has either a significant effect beyond the internal operating procedures of the agency issuing the policy, regulation, procedure or form, or has a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors. This final rule is not required to be published for public comment, because it clarifies the application of the micro-purchase threshold as it relates to DoD procurements, and does not have significant effect beyond the internal operating procedures of the agency issuing the policy. These requirements affect only the internal operating procedures of the Government.</p>
                    <h2 id="h-10">IV. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563</h2>
                    <p id="p-10" data-page="24895">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993. This rule is not a major rule under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/804" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 804</a>.</p>

</h2>
                    <p id="p-11" data-page="24895">This rule is not an <a href="/executive-order/13771" class="eo">E.O. 13771</a>, Reducing and Controlling Regulatory Costs, regulatory action, because this rule is not significant under <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>.</p>
                    <h2 id="h-12">VII. Regulatory Flexibility Act</h2>
                    <p id="p-12" data-page="24895">
                        Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment are not required to be given for this rule under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1707" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1707(a)(1)</a> (see section III. of this preamble), the analytical requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>
