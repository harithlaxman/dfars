                        DoD, GSA, and NASA published a proposed rule in the 
                        <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                         at <a href="/citation/79-FR-71975" class="fr-reference" data-reference="79 FR 71975">79 FR 71975</a> on December 4, 2014. The comment period closed on February 2, 2015. Two respondents submitted comments on the proposed rule.

                        The final rule implements section 852 of the NDAA for FY 2013 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/112/public/239" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 112-239</a>) with regard to Federal contracts. Section 852 requires that the FAPIIS include, to the extent practicable, information on any parent, subsidiary, or successor entities to a corporation in a manner designed to give the acquisition officials using the database a comprehensive understanding of the performance and integrity of the corporation in carrying out Federal contracts and grants. This final rule addresses the collection of information with regard to offerors that are responding to a solicitation for a Federal contract. The data on the immediate owner and direct subsidiaries of an entity will be available through FAPIIS, based on the data obtained from offerors in response to the FAR provision 52.204-17, Ownership or Control of Offeror, which was published in the 
                        <strong>Federal Register</strong>

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent commented that it would be helpful if the relevant FAR provisions and FAR clause 52.204-20 clarified whether the three year &ldquo;lookback&rdquo; period starts on the effective date of when the predecessor merged or was acquired by the successor or the date the contracts of the predecessor were novated from the predecessor to the successor.

                        <em>Response:</em>
                         The &ldquo;lookback&rdquo; period starts on the date the offeror signs the representation. If, within the three years prior to signing the representation, there was a merger or acquisition, it shall be reported. The date of novation is not relevant for purposes of this rule.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent supported the statute because it requires that information be provided to the contracting officers to aid in making responsibility determinations, and supported the position that the &ldquo;further the distance between entities, the less relevant the information is likely to be for establishing responsibility of the offeror.&rdquo;

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent commented that the proposed rule's requirement to report data on all predecessors of the offeror that received a Federal contract or grant within the last three years would apply an undue burden on prospective contractors and not achieve the Government's stated objective of providing a more comprehensive understanding of a potential contractor's performance and integrity. The respondent proposed that publicly traded companies subject to Securities and Exchange Commission requirements be exempt from this requirement because it instills a burden without benefit to the Government.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent commented that large multi-national organizations many times reorganize business units in order to effectively respond to changing needs of the marketplace. These reorganizations can include alternate legal structures. The assets of one legal entity may pass through three or four more before landing at the new entity. The respondent proposed that where the ultimate owner remains the same before and after a transaction, the contractor be exempted from providing information on predecessor entities. According to the respondent, this is consistent with the Government's exclusion of a &ldquo;new offices/divisions of the same company&rdquo; from the definition of &ldquo;successor&rdquo;.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent commented that contracting officers and their counsel perform a rigorous review and analysis to deal with the novation process and feels that there should be no requirement to identify prior owners within the FAPIIS because the required responsibility determination would have been conducted through novation.

                         The respondent commented that the reporting of the ultimate owners became effective on November 1, 2014, and believe that agencies should allow contractors and contracting officers time to implement and evaluate the results of this new requirement before adding more requirements that may not aid contracting officers in responsibility and integrity evaluations.

Because the emphasis of section 852 of the NDAA for FY 2013 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/112/public/239" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub.

The objective of this rule is to provide acquisition officials using the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) a comprehensive understanding of the performance and integrity of the corporation in carrying out Federal contracts.
