                     Some respondents voiced concerns that the rule will only apply to contracts at or below the simplified acquisition threshold (SAT).

                     The rule applies to all contracts for contract working dogs, as defined in <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2387" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2387(c)</a>, including those valued at or below the SAT.

                <p id="p-14" data-page="11745">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     Some respondents were concerned that a contract working dog would be replaced instead of retired under a service contract, avoiding the termination and transfer of the dog.
                </p>
                <p id="p-15" data-page="11745">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     DoD generally contracts for a team consisting of the working dog and handler under a service contract. Service contracts include standards of performance for the team. If the team cannot perform to the standard, the contractor is generally expected to replace the team with a team that can perform to the standard. The statute recognizes that the inability to perform to the standard in an individual DoD contract does not mean that a dog has met the conditions for retirement or termination. Specifically, the contract working dog service life would continue if the dog could be utilized on another Federal Government contract, which could have different standards than a DoD contract.
                </p>
                <p id="p-16" data-page="11745">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     A respondent expressed concerns that the proposed rule explanation of the impact characterized the need for a contracting officer to make a determination as &ldquo;rare&rdquo; because it may be assumed that a dog's service life would never be terminated.

                <p id="p-17" data-page="11745">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     As noted in section IV of the preamble for the proposed rule, DoD does not expect the impact of the rule to be significant because the number of acquisitions that include contract working dogs and handlers are few in number. If the contracting officer's representative or requiring activity identifies a non-performing working dog and handler, an assessment will be conducted by Government experts to

                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     Some respondents asserted that contract working dogs are paired with military and DoD civilian handlers and that DoD's statement to the contrary, provided in the preamble for the proposed rule, is inaccurate. The respondents refer to DoD Inspector General (DoDIG) report 2018-081, entitled &ldquo;The Army's Tactical Explosive Detection Dog Disposition Process from 2011 to 2014.&rdquo;

                <p id="p-19" data-page="11746">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     This rule addresses contract working dogs that are not Government-owned property (see <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2387" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2387(c)</a>). Contract working dogs addressed by this rule are not paired with military personnel or DoD civilian employee handlers. The respondent's references to DoDIG report 2018-081 seem to indicate a misunderstanding of the difference between a contract working dog and those working dogs procured as Government property under the military working dog and Tactical Explosive Detection Dog (TEDD) programs. The TEDD program authorized the procurement of a working dog and provided that a contractor, rather than the Government, train, house, and care for the dog through certification under the military working dog standards. The Government owned these military working dogs and was responsible for their disposition in accordance with <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2583" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2583</a>.

                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     Some respondents requested that the final rule include a penalty for noncompliance.

                <p id="p-21" data-page="11746">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The statute does not provide a specific penalty for contractor noncompliance; however, contracting officers may use existing contracting regulations to enforce the terms of the contract.

                <h3 id="h-16">C. Other Changes</h3>
                <p id="p-22" data-page="11746">Text at DFARS contract clause 252.237-7027, Transfer and Adoption of Military Animals, is revised for clarity. At DFARS 237.7804, the prescription for the clause is also revised for clarity.</p>
                <h2 id="h-17">III. Applicability to Contracts at or Below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT) and for Commercial Services and Commercial Products, Including Commercially Available Off-the-Shelf (COTS) Items</h2>
                <p id="p-23" data-page="11746">The contract clause at DFARS 252.237-7027, Transfer and Adoption of Military Animals, is prescribed at DFARS 237.7804 for use in solicitations and contracts, including solicitations and contracts using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12 procedures for commercial products and commercial services, that require the services of a contract working dog. Consistent with the analysis that DoD provided in the proposed rule with regard to the application of the requirements of section 372(f) of the NDAA for FY 2020, DoD has made the determination to apply the statute, as implemented in the clause at DFARS 252.237-7027, to contracts at or below the SAT and to the acquisition of commercial services, as defined at FAR 2.101.</p>
                <h2 id="h-18">IV. Expected Impact of the Rule</h2>
                <p id="p-24" data-page="11746">DoD does not expect the rule to have a significant impact on the public, because the need for a contracting officer to make a determination that a contract working dog has reached the end of its service life will be rare. Such acquisitions are few in number, and service contractors who provide contract working dogs and handlers are expected to replace dogs and handlers who are unable to perform to DoD standards. A contracting officer's representative (COR) would be responsible for monitoring contract performance and coordinating any replacement dog and handler requirements. If the COR or requiring activity identifies a non-performing working dog and handler, an assessment will be conducted by Government experts to determine if the conditions at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2387" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2387(b)</a> are met before a recommendation is provided to the contracting officer for action.</p>

                <p id="p-25" data-page="11746">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility.

A major rule under the Congressional Review Act cannot take effect until 60 days after it is published in the
