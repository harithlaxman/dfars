                <h2 id="h-9">III. Applicability to Acquisitions Not Greater Than the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT) and Commercial Items</h2>
                <p id="p-12" data-page="73491"><a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2279" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2279</a> is silent on applicability to contracts and subcontracts in amounts not greater than the SAT or for the acquisition of commercial items. Also, the statute does not provide for criminal or civil penalties. Therefore, it does not apply to the acquisition of contracts and subcontracts in amounts not greater than the SAT or the acquisition of commercial items unless the Director, DPAP, makes a written determination as provided in <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1905" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1905</a>.</p>
                <p id="p-13" data-page="73491">There is a potential risk to national security if DoD uses commercial satellite services for DoD communications and the government of a covered foreign country has an ownership interest that enables the government to affect satellite operations, regardless of the dollar value of the contract or order. Likewise, if launch or other satellite services under the contract are occurring in a covered country, the government of that country could impact the ability of the foreign entity to adequately provide those services. Furthermore, although <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2279" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2279</a> does not specifically reference <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1906" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1906</a>, the statute only applies to the acquisition of commercial satellite services, so exempting commercial items from application of the statute would negate the intended effect of the statute. Therefore, consistent with <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1905" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1905</a> and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1906" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1906</a>, the Director, Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy, determined that it would not be in the best interest of the United States to exempt acquisitions not greater than the SAT and acquisitions of commercial items from the applicability of <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2279" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2279</a>.</p>
                <h2 id="h-10">IV. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563</h2>
                <p id="p-14" data-page="73491">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993. This rule is not a major rule under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/804" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 804</a>.</p>
                <h2 id="h-11">V. Regulatory Flexibility Act</h2>
                <p id="p-15" data-page="73491">
                    This final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>,

                     However, a final regulatory flexibility analysis has been performed and is summarized as follows:
                </p>
                <p id="p-16" data-page="73491">DoD is converting to a final rule, without change, an interim rule that amended the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) to implement section 1602 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY 2014. Section 1602 added <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2279" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2279</a>, which prohibits acquisition of commercial satellite services from certain foreign entities.</p>
                <p id="p-17" data-page="73491">The objective of the rule is to implement <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2279" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2279</a>, which is the legal basis for the rule. The statute prohibits award of contracts for commercial satellite services to a foreign entity that&mdash;</p>
                
            <ul class="bullets" >
          <li id="p-18" data-page="73491">Is an entity in which the government of a covered foreign country (<em>i.e.</em>, the People's Republic of China, North Korea, Cuba, Iran, Sudan, or Syria) has an ownership interest that enables the government to affect satellite operations; or

                <p id="p-21" data-page="73491">DoD estimates that this rule will apply to less than 111 small entities. According to Federal Procurement Data System data for FY 2013, 111 small entities were awarded contracts or orders for services in PSC D304 (ADP Telecommunications and Transmission Services), of which commercial satellite services are a subset. Although the focus of the Regulatory Flexibility Act is protection of domestic small business entities that are eligible for assistance from the Small Business Administration, there may be domestic small business entities in the United States that offer the satellite services of a foreign entity that would be restricted by this rule.</p>
                <p id="p-22" data-page="73491">This rule requires an annual representation as to whether the offeror is, or is not, a foreign entity subject to the prohibitions of the statute or is, or is not, offering commercial satellite services provided by such a foreign entity. Further information is required if the offeror provides an affirmative response to any of the representations, but such affirmative response and further submission is expected to be extremely rare.</p>
                <p id="p-23" data-page="73491">This rule will not have a significant economic impact on any small entities, unless they are offering commercial satellite services provided by a foreign entity that is subject to the restrictions of this rule. DoD was not able to identify any alternatives that would reduce the burden on small entities and meet the objectives of the rule.</p>
