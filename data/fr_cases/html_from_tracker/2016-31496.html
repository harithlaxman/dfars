                    <p id="p-7" data-page="4716">
                        DOD, GSA, and NASA published a proposed rule in the 
                        <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                         at <a href="/citation/81-FR-39882" class="fr-reference" data-reference="81 FR 39882">81 FR 39882</a> on June 20, 2016, to implement section 816 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/114/public/92" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 114-92</a>). FAR 2.101, 13.003, 19.203, and 19.502-2 are being revised to increase the simplified acquisition threshold for special emergency procurement authority from $300,000 to $750,000 (within the United States) and from $1 million to $1.5 million (outside the United States). The rule would apply to acquisitions of supplies or services that, as determined by the head of the agency, are to be used to support a contingency operation or to facilitate defense against or recovery from nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological attack. Two respondents provided comments on the proposed rule.
                    </p>
                    <h2 id="h-8">II. Discussion and Analysis</h2>
                    <p id="p-8" data-page="4716">The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council (the Councils) reviewed the comments in the development of the final rule. A discussion of the comments is provided.</p>
                    <h3 id="h-9">A. Summary of Changes</h3>
                    <p id="p-9" data-page="4716">There was no change made to the rule as a result of the comments received. There were no comments on the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis.</p>

                    <h4 id="h-11">1. Small Business</h4>
                    <p id="p-10" data-page="4716">
                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         The respondent identified that the proposed rule did not recognize that the automatic set-asides for small business would apply up to the threshold in paragraph (1)(ii) of the simplified acquisition threshold definition at FAR 2.101 in the case of an emergency acquisition in an outlying area as defined in FAR 2.101.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-11" data-page="4716">
                        <em>Response:</em>
                         The proposed rule did not address the issue of the outlying areas. While the comment is out of scope of this rule, the Councils will take the comment under consideration.
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="h-12">2. Increased Simplified Acquisition Threshold</h4>
                    <p id="p-12" data-page="4716">
                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         The respondent opposes the increase in the special emergency procurement threshold, because increases to the acquisition threshold threaten to compromise the integrity of the Berry amendment, outsource critical portions of the domestic industrial base, and hurt American manufacturers.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-13" data-page="4716">
                        <em>Response:</em>
                         The Councils appreciate the comment and acknowledge the concern; however, the increase in the special emergency procurement threshold is statutory in nature.

                    <p id="p-14" data-page="4716">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under Section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993.

                    <p id="p-15" data-page="4716">
                        DoD, GSA, and NASA have prepared a Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (FRFA) consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>, 
                        <em>et seq.</em>
                         The FRFA is summarized as follows:

                        <p id="p-16" data-page="4716">This final rule implements section 816 of the National Authorization Act for Fiscal Year (FY) 2016, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/114/public/92" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Public Law 114-92</a>. Therefore, the FAR is revised to raise the simplified acquisition thresholds for special emergency procurement authority.</p>
                        <p id="p-17" data-page="4716">The objective of this final rule is to increase the simplified acquisition thresholds for special emergency procurement authority from $300,000 to $750,000 (within the United States) and $1 million to $1.5 million (outside the United States) for acquisitions of supplies or services that, as determined by the head of the agency, are to be used to support a contingency operation or to facilitate defense against or recovery from nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological attack.</p>

                            DoD, GSA, and NASA do not expect this final rule to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>, 
                            <em>et seq.,</em>
                             because the rule raises the simplified acquisition threshold for special emergency procurements, an arena in which a smaller percentage of small businesses participate, as compared to larger businesses. Between $300,000 and the increase to $750,000, 188 total awards were made of which 45 or 24 percent were to small businesses in FY 2014, and 219 total awards were made of which 66 or 30 percent were to small businesses in FY
