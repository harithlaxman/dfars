                <h2 id="h-7">I. Background</h2>
                <p id="p-6" data-page="53681">DoD is amending the DFARS to remove the definition of &ldquo;micro-purchase threshold&rdquo; at DFARS 202.101. Section 821 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 amends <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2338" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2338</a> by increasing the micro-purchase threshold for DoD from $5,000 to $10,000 and repealing <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2339" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2339</a>. An exception to the $5,000 micro-purchase threshold is provided at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2339" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2339</a> for basic research and activities of DoD science and technology reinvention laboratories with a micro-purchase threshold of $10,000 for those activities. The DFARS definition at 202.101, which includes a micro-purchase threshold of $5,000 for DoD with the exception of $10,000 for basic research and activities of DoD science and technology reinvention laboratories, is now obsolete. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) definition of micro-purchase threshold now applies to DoD, so the outdated DFARS coverage is being removed.</p>
                <h2 id="h-8">II. Applicability to Contracts at or Below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold and for Commercial Items, Including Commercially Available Off-the-Shelf Items</h2>
                <p id="p-7" data-page="53681">This rule only removes the obsolete DFARS &ldquo;micro-purchase threshold&rdquo; definition at 202.101. Therefore, the rule does not impose any new requirements on contracts at or below the simplified acquisition threshold and for commercial items, including commercially available off-the-shelf items.</p>
                <h2 id="h-9">III. Publication of This Final Rule for Public Comment Is Not Required by Statute</h2>
                <p id="p-8" data-page="53681">The statute that applies to the publication of the FAR is the Office of Federal Procurement Policy statute (codified at title 41 of the United States Code). Specifically, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1707" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1707(a)(1)</a> requires that a procurement policy, regulation, procedure or form (including an amendment or modification thereof) must be published for public comment if it relates to the expenditure of appropriated funds, and has either a significant effect beyond the internal operating procedures of the agency issuing the policy, regulation, procedure, or form, or has a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors. This final rule is not required to be published for public comment, because DoD is not issuing a new regulation; rather, this rule merely removes an obsolete definition from the DFARS.</p>
                <h2 id="h-10">IV. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563</h2>
                <p id="p-9" data-page="53681">Executive Order (E.O.) 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review; and <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a>, Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review, direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. The Office of Management and Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), has determined that this is not a significant regulatory action as defined under section 3(f) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a> and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b). This rule is not a major rule as defined at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/804" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 804(2)</a>.</p>
                <h2 id="h-11">V. <a href="/executive-order/13771" class="eo">Executive Order 13771</a>
</h2>
                <p id="p-10" data-page="53681">This rule is not an <a href="/executive-order/13771" class="eo">E.O. 13771</a> regulatory action, because this rule is not significant under <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>.</p>
                <h2 id="h-12">VI. Regulatory Flexibility Act</h2>
                <p id="p-11" data-page="53681">
                    Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment are not required to be given for this rule under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1707" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1707(a)(1)</a> (see section III. of this preamble), the analytical requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a> 
                    <em>et seq.</em>) are not applicable. Accordingly, no regulatory flexibility analysis is required and none has been prepared.
                </p>
                <h2 id="h-13">VII. Paperwork Reduction Act</h2>
                <p id="p-12" data-page="53681">The rule does not contain any information collection requirements that require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/44/3501" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44 U.S.C. chapter 35</a>).</p>
