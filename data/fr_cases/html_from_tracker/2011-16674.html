                        DoD, GSA, and NASA published an interim rule in the 
                        <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                         at <a href="/citation/75-FR-77739" class="fr-reference" data-reference="75 FR 77739">75 FR 77739</a> on December 13, 2010, to implement section 815 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/111/public/84" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 111-84</a>). Section 815 amends section 2455(c)(1) of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (FASA) (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/31/6101" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">31 U.S.C. 6101 note</a>) by amending the definition of &ldquo;procurement activities&rdquo; to include subcontracts at any tier, except&mdash;

          <li id="p-8" data-page="39236">It does not include subcontracts for commercially available off-the-shelf items (COTS); and</li>
                    <li id="p-9" data-page="39236">In the case of commercial items, such term includes only the first-tier subcontracts.</li>

                    <p id="p-10" data-page="39236">This has the effect, except for commercial items and COTS items, of expanding the requirement of section 2455(a), which states that &ldquo;No agency shall allow a party to participate in any procurement * * * activity if any agency has debarred, suspended, or otherwise excluded * * * that party from participation in a procurement * * * activity.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p id="p-11" data-page="39236">Therefore, the interim rule amended the FAR clause at 52.209-6, Protecting the Government's Interest When Subcontracting with Contractors Debarred, Suspended, or Proposed for Debarment, by flowing down the requirements for the contractor or higher-tier subcontractor to check whether a subcontractor beyond the first tier is debarred, suspended, or proposed for debarment, with the stated dollar threshold and exceptions for commercial items and COTS items. As in the current clause, the contractor and higher-tier subcontractors must also notify the contracting officer in writing before entering into a subcontract with a party that is debarred, suspended, or proposed for debarment, providing the contractor's knowledge of the reasons for the subcontractor being on the Excluded Parties Systems List, and the compelling reasons for doing business with the subcontractor, as well as the systems and procedures the contractor has established to ensure that it is fully protecting the Government's interests. The contracting officer will now have more visibility into whether lower- tier subcontractors have been debarred, suspended, or proposed for debarment. Because commercial contracts must now flow the requirement down to the first tier, the clause was added to FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders&mdash;Commercial Items.</p>

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent recommended deletion of the definition of COTS item from paragraph (a) of the FAR clause 52.209-6. The rationale is that the term is defined in FAR 2.101 and is therefore unnecessary in the clause.

                        <em>Response:</em>
                         The Councils have retained the definition of COTS item in the clause. Although the clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, provides for the applicability of definitions in FAR 2.101 to words or terms used in a solicitation provision or contract clause, unless the solicitation provides a different definition, or certain other exceptions apply, it is common practice to include the definition of important terms in solicitation provisions and contract clauses, for clarity and ease of use.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         Two respondents supported the interim rule but hoped that the Councils will eliminate the exceptions for commercial item and COTS item acquisition contracts.

                        <em>Response:</em>
                         The statute specifically stated that contracts for COTS items are exempt and that for contracts for commercial items, the requirements only flow to the first-tier subcontracts. The rule implements the statutory requirements.

                    <p id="p-24" data-page="39237">According to the respondent, if the subcontract is for COTS or commercial items, the clause will not flow down to any subcontractor, because the prime contractor is responsible for determining the suspension and debarment status of only first-tier commercial item subcontractors and the prime contractor is not responsible for determining the suspension and debarment status for COTS subcontractors.</p>
                    <p id="p-25" data-page="39237">
                        <em>Response:</em>
                         According to the statute, the prohibition on subcontracting with entities that have been debarred, suspended, or proposed for debarment applies to subcontractors at any tier, other than subcontractors for COTS items, except that in the case of a contract for commercial items, such term includes only first-tier subcontracts.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-26" data-page="39237">
                        The difference between the revised language proposed by the respondent and the language that was proposed in the 
                        <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                         is in the treatment of a subcontract for a commercial item. Both versions will arrive at the same result with regard to a prime contract for a commercial item and the first-tier subcontracts under that commercial contract. In such case, each first-tier subcontract (over $30,000 and not a COTS item) will have to disclose whether at time of subcontract award it, or its principals, is debarred, suspended, or proposed for debarment.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-27" data-page="39237">However, with regard to subcontracts for the acquisition of a commercial item (which were not specifically addressed by the statute), the proposed rule implemented the statute to also apply to the subcontract one tier below a commercial subcontract for the acquisition of a commercial item, whereas the proposed revision does not apply the requirements of the statute to a subcontract under a commercial subcontract. The Councils consider the language of the proposed rule to be a reasonable interpretation of the statutory intent, by requiring all commercial contractors (whether a prime contractor or a higher-tier subcontractor), to get the reports of the next-tier subcontractors, but not be required to flow the requirement down to the next tier. To adopt the interpretation of the respondent would narrow the ability of agencies to determine if a subcontractor has been debarred, suspended, or proposed for debarment because agencies would have no visibility into the debarment/suspension status of any subcontract that was one level below a subcontract for the acquisition of a commercial item. This appears to be contrary to the intent of the statute.</p>

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent believes that the Councils should provide a clarification of the term &ldquo;compelling reason&rdquo; as it appears in FAR 9.405-2(b) and 52.209-6(b). FAR 9.405-2(b) and the clause at 52.209-6(b) state that contractors shall not enter into subcontracts in excess of $30,000, other than a subcontract for a COTS item, with a contractor that has been debarred, suspended, or proposed for debarment, unless there is a compelling reason to do so.

                         The Councils believe this request is outside the scope of this case. The term &ldquo;compelling reason&rdquo; was not instituted with the current FAR case, which simply removed applicability to COTS items and extended flowdown of the requirement to lower-tier subcontracts.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent requested that both parentheticals indicating applicability be removed from the listing of the clause 52.209-6 in FAR 52.212-5 (commercial items) and 52.213-4 (simplified acquisition). The rationale of the respondent is that the directives are not complete and are not used in most clauses contained in these clauses. In addition, the respondent states that FAR 52.209-6 already states when the clause is applicable and applicability to subcontracts is covered in FAR 52.209-6(e).
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-31" data-page="39237">
                        <em>Response:</em>
                         With regard to FAR 52.212-5, the contracting officer indicates if the clause applies to the acquisition of commercial items. The respondent is correct that no parenthetical indication of applicability is appropriate, unless the clause is applicable to the acquisition of commercial items, but is not applicable to the acquisition of COTS items (
                        <em>e.g.,</em>
                         FAR 52.223-9, Estimate of Percentage of Recovered Material). However, indication of inapplicability to subcontracts for COTS items is not appropriate. That is covered in the FAR clause itself, once it is decided that the clause is applicable to the prime contract. The Councils have removed both parentheticals from the listing of FAR 52.209-6 in the FAR clause 52.212-5 in the final rule.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-32" data-page="39237">However, with regard to the FAR clause 52.213-4, the Councils do not agree that there should be no parenthetical indication of applicability for the listed clauses. Unless the clause is required in all contracts, each of the clauses listed in paragraph (b) of FAR 52.213-4 indicates applicability parenthetically. However, this indication of applicability should be to the prime contract, not the subcontract. Therefore, the statement of inapplicability to subcontracts for the acquisition of COTS items has been deleted from the final rule.</p>

                        The Department of Defense, the General Services Administration, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration certify that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>,

                         The interim rule removed requirements relating to subcontracts for COTS items. In the case of commercial items, the requirement extends only to the first-tier subcontracts. This rule will impact small entities that are awarded a lower-tier subcontract for a non-COTS item that exceeds $30,000, in that these entities must now disclose to the higher-tier subcontractor whether they are debarred, suspended, or proposed for debarment. Although a substantial number of small entities may be impacted by this rule, the impact is not significant. It will probably take only minimal time to include the required information with an offer. For the other impact of the rule, which will require the higher-tier subcontractor to provide an explanation if desiring to subcontract with an entity that has been debarred, suspended, or proposed for debarment, DoD, GSA, and NASA have determined that this will not impact a substantial number of small entities, because it should be a rare occurrence that a subcontractor would potentially jeopardize performance or integrity by knowingly contracting with an entity that is debarred, suspended, or proposed for debarment. No public comments were received with regard to the impact of this rule on small entities.
