                        DoD published two interim rules in the 
                        <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                         on August 26, 2015 (<a href="/citation/80-FR-51739" class="fr-reference" data-reference="80 FR 51739">80 FR 51739</a>), and December 30, 2015 (<a href="/citation/80-FR-81472" class="fr-reference" data-reference="80 FR 81472">80 FR 81472</a>), to implement section 941 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2013 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/112/public/239" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub.

L. 113-291</a>) regarding contractor reporting of network penetrations, as well as DoD policies and procedures with regard to purchases of cloud computing services. This final rule also implements, for DoD, section 325 of the Intelligence Authorization Act for FY 2014 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/113/public/126" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub.

                        1. The definition of &ldquo;covered defense information&rdquo; is amended to clarify that, in order to be designated as covered defense information, the information must be controlled technical information or other information (as described in the Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) Registry) that requires safeguarding or dissemination controls and is (1) marked or otherwise identified in the contract, task order, or delivery order, and provided to the contractor by or on behalf of DoD in connection with the performance of the contract; or (2) collected, developed, received, transmitted, used, or stored by or on behalf of the contractor in support of the performance of the contract. This definition is in line with the National Archives and Record Administration (NARA) &ldquo;Controlled Unclassified Information&rdquo; final rule published in the

Covered defense information includes all of the categories of information that are considered CUI. The rule also now specifies that all covered contractor information systems need to be protected in accordance with DFARS clause 252.204-7012, Safeguarding Covered Defense Information and Cyber Incident Reporting.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         Multiple respondents commented on the applicability of the rule to contracts and subcontracts for commercial and COTS items. One suggested that the full potential impact of the interim rule on commercial providers should be studied and quantified by DoD before implementation of the rule. Others suggested that the vast majority of commercial contracts do not require that DoD provide information in order for the contractor or subcontractor to perform the work, and that the clause should only apply when DoD provides controlled unclassified information to a contractor as a necessary predicate to performing the contract. One respondent recommended that DoD exempt contracts for commercial and COTS items from application of the final rule or, in the alternative, exempt subcontractors supplying commercial or COTS items from the final rule.

                         The definition of covered defense information has been amended to clarify, as suggested by the respondents, that in order to be designated as covered defense information, the information must be marked or otherwise identified in the contract and provided to the contractor by or on behalf of DoD in connection with the performance of the contract; or collected, developed, received, transmitted, used, or stored by or on behalf of the contractor in support of the performance of the contract. In addition, to clarify that the rule does not apply to COTS items, the prescriptions at DFARS 204.7304 for use of the provision at 252.204-7008 and the clause at 252.204-7012 are amended to exclude solicitations and contracts solely for the acquisition of COTS items.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         Several respondents requested clarification regarding the application of the security requirements embedded in DFARS clause 252.204-7012 to fundamental research.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-24" data-page="72987">
                        <em>Response:</em>
                         The security requirements in 252.204-7012 need to be in place when covered defense information is present. A contract or project that is appropriately scoped as fundamental research will not contain any covered defense information. The final rule is modified to only flow down the requirements of 252.204-7012 to subcontractors when subcontract performance is for operationally critical support or will involve covered defense information, which means the clause will not flow down to subcontractors that are exclusively performing fundamental research. DFARS clause 252.204-7000 is modified to ensure that it is clear that no covered defense information is involved when making a fundamental research determination.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent noted that it is unclear whether the clause applies to covered defense information resident on contractor classified information systems. While the covered defense information itself has been explicitly defined as unclassified, covered contractor systems are not specified as such.

                         One respondent noted that the mandatory flowdowns of the data security and penetration reporting requirements to health care providers who are subcontractors to military health care plans should be amended to provide that such providers who comply with their data security obligations under Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act are deemed to be in compliance with DoD's data security rules.

                         If the covered defense information provided is DoD HIPAA, then the requirement would be to meet both HIPAA and NIST SP 800-171. There are requirements of HIPAA that are not in 800-171, just as there are requirements in 800-171 that are not in HIPAA. DFARS 204.7300(b) states that the rule &ldquo;does not abrogate any other requirements regarding contractor physical, personnel, information, technical, or general administrative security operations governing the protection of unclassified information.&rdquo;

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         Several respondents commented on the cost impact to small businesses. One respondent suggested that this rule will impact subcontracting cycles and deliveries throughout the DoD supply chain, due to the inability for smaller suppliers to afford the investment and skilled labor force required to meet and manage these requirements. Multiple respondents requested that, due to the high cost of compliance, DoD provide for an alternative approach for small business. One respondent suggested that DoD consider collaborating with universities or other companies, to provide low-cost cybersecurity services to small businesses, or providing a one-time subsidy to small businesses to help cover the cost of initial consultations with third party vendors. Another suggested that DoD coordinate with the Small Business Administration, Department of Commerce, and other relevant executive agencies, to establish policy, training mechanisms, and learning centers that allow access to the necessary resources to assist small and commercial businesses in creating compliant information systems.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-30" data-page="72987">
                        <em>Response:</em>
                         While it is understood that implementing the minimum security controls outlined in the DFARS clause may increase costs, protection of unclassified DoD information is deemed necessary. The cost to the nation in lost intellectual property and lost technological advantage over potential adversaries is much greater than these initial/ongoing investments. The value of the information (and impact of its loss) does not diminish when it moves to contractors (prime or sub, large or small). NIST SP 800-171 was carefully crafted to use performance-based requirements and eliminate unnecessary specificity and include only those security requirements necessary to provide adequate protections for the impact level of CUI (
                        <em>e.g.,</em>
                         covered defense information). Implementation of the NIST SP 800-171 security requirements will provide significant benefit to the small business community in the form of increased protection of their intellectual property. In addition, defining one set of standards will help small businesses to avoid a situation in which small business must adopt multiple standards and rule sets as small businesses navigate amongst the many different organizations with which they do business. The addition of a new provision at 252.204-7008, Compliance with Safeguarding Covered Defense Information Controls, ensures that the offeror is aware of the requirements of clause 252.204-7012 and has time to bring their system into compliance and negotiate the terms of the contract accordingly. With regard to training, DoD will engage across both Government and industry to educate and raise awareness of the importance of protecting our controlled unclassified information and to address implementation of the rule.

                         Several respondents suggested that the definition of &ldquo;covered defense information&rdquo; is too expansive, requiring that data be safeguarded without clear marking instructions and identification of operational processes. Several respondents commented that contractors should not be required to make independent decisions regarding whether information is subject to safeguarding requirements, and that the rule limit its application only to covered defense information marked or expressly identified as protected by DoD. One respondent requested clarification that the rule only imposes restrictions on covered defense information that DoD provides to the contractor to perform the contract. Another respondent suggested that the relationship between &ldquo;controlled defense information&rdquo; and &ldquo;controlled unclassified information&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Controlled Unclassified Information Registry (CUI Registry)&rdquo; should be clearly articulated. Two respondents suggested that covered data be limited to the &ldquo;unclassified controlled technical information&rdquo; covered in the predecessor DFARS rule. One of the respondents further suggested that if the scope is not focused back to the &ldquo;unclassified controlled technical information&rdquo; definition, the rule should define covered defense information to specifically exclude the contractor's own information that is not delivered to the Government. One respondent commented that, because it is not possible to contemplate every type of information that may arise in the future, it would be prudent to set forth in the rule a centralized process that contractors could use when it is not clear whether a specific type of information falls within the definition of &ldquo;covered defense information&rdquo; to ensure that information is treated consistently across contracts and commands. This respondent further stated that the rule should provide a standard for evaluating whether a contractor has reasonably complied with the rule when faced with a judgment call as to whether information falls within the definition.

This revised definition adds an affirmative requirement for Government to mark or otherwise identify in the contract all covered defense information that is being provided to the contractor, while recognizing the shared obligation of the contractor to recognize and protect covered defense information that the contractor is developing during contract performance. In addition, paragraph (b) of DFARS clause 252.204-7012 is amended to clarify that adequate security is required on all covered contractor information systems. Paragraph (m)(1) of the clause is also modified to indicate that, if necessary, the contractor shall determine if the information required for subcontractor performance retains its identity as covered defense information and will require protection under this clause and, if necessary, consult with the contracting officer.

One respondent suggested this section be reworded as follows: &ldquo;Unclassified information concerning items requiring licenses under the export administration regulations, or the international trafficking in arms regulations and munitions list.&rdquo; Another respondent suggested that DoD define &ldquo;export controlled information&rdquo; in the final rule, since particular categories of International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)&mdash;controlled technical data and designated control list categories of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), such as national security, nonproliferation, and missile technology. Several respondents suggested the definition of &ldquo;export control&rdquo; be limited to technologies subject to the EAR, ITAR, or nuclear export regulations. One respondent suggested that DoD exclude items from its definition of &ldquo;covered defense information&rdquo; that are subject to minimal export controls.

Export control is a category in the CUI Registry, but it is only considered covered defense information when both DoD contractors hold unclassified information that is export controlled, and the information is &ldquo;provided to the contractor by or on behalf of DoD in connection with the performance of the contract, or collected, developed, received, transmitted, used, or stored by or on behalf of the contractor in support of the performance of the contract,&rdquo; as defined in the final rule. Protecting DoD-related export controlled information as covered defense information should not be interpreted to imply that the same information, not related to the DoD activity, requires protection as covered defense information.

                         Several respondents commented on how the rule addresses &ldquo;operationally critical support&rdquo; and &ldquo;critical information (operations security)&rdquo; and requested clarification of the terms &ldquo;critical information&rdquo; and &ldquo;operations security.&rdquo; One respondent commented that the rule indicates that the Government will designate which supplies or services are critical for airlift, etc., but the rule neither indicates where such information will be found, nor defines a process for designating contractors in this category or notifying such contractors that they are critical to operational support. Another respondent suggested that while the interim rule suggests that DoD will designate specific portions of its contracts that it considers to be &ldquo;operationally critical support,&rdquo; the scope of what constitutes a contractor's &ldquo;ability to provide operationally critical support&rdquo; is so vague that it may not accomplish its purpose. This respondent recommended that DoD clarify that a reportable incident occurs when a cyber incident affects the security or integrity of operationally critical information residing in a contractor information system. One respondent commented that ambiguities with regard to operationally critical support are particularly concerning to the transportation industry, suggesting that it is not clear whether &ldquo;package level detail&rdquo; which includes information about the identity of the shipping and receiving parties and the delivery address is considered &ldquo;covered defense information.&rdquo; This respondent also suggested that a cyber incident that affects the contractor's ability to perform &ldquo;operationally critical support&rdquo; could also include incidents on systems beyond &ldquo;covered information systems&rdquo; and the interim rule requires reporting of those incidents, as well. Another respondent requested DoD clarify how or whether the term &ldquo;operationally critical&rdquo; applies to contractors/subcontractors.

                         requires safeguarding or dissemination controls pursuant to and consistent with law, regulations, and Governmentwide policies.&rdquo; Because &ldquo;critical information (operations security)&rdquo; is not currently listed on the CUI Registry, it can no longer, in and of itself, be designated as covered defense information. Section 1632 of the NDAA for FY 2015, which requires that a contractor designated as operationally critical report each time a cyber incident occurs on that contractor's network or information systems, is implemented via the DFARS clause 252.204-7012 requirement for contractors and subcontractors to report cyber incidents that result in an actual or potentially adverse effect on a their ability to provide operationally critical support. Operationally critical support is an &ldquo;activity&rdquo;&mdash;not an information type&mdash;performed by the contractor or subcontract. DFARS does not require protections for contractor information systems that are used to provide operationally critical support, but does require the contractor to report a cyber incident that affects the contractor's ability to perform the requirements of the contract that are designated as operationally critical support. Operationally critical support requirements must be marked or otherwise identified in the contract, task order, or delivery order.

One respondent suggested that this results in them incurring costs due to the changes involved. Other respondents recommended that, in lieu of each contractor negotiating the phase-in relief provided in the amended rules on every transaction, DoD issue a block change modification to all contracts where the relevant August interim rule clauses are present to adopt the December 30 changes and allow for equitable adjustment to the contract price. One respondent suggested that DoD consider issuing instructions to contracting officers to substitute the most recent version of this clause for older versions, at the request of the contractor.

                         The security requirements in NIST SP 800-171 build upon the table of controls contained in the November 2013 version of DFARS clause 252.204-7012. While there is additional effort for the difference, none of the effort to implement the original controls is lost. Due to the differences in the multiple versions of 252.204-7012, however, amending the contract requires procuring contracting officer authority and is generally bilateral, requiring contractor signature. &ldquo;Block changes&rdquo; and &ldquo;mass modifications&rdquo; are generally reserved for administrative changes, such as a payment office address change. There is nothing that precludes a contracting officer from considering a modification of the contract upon request of the contractor.

                         No new oversight paradigm is created through this rule.

The requirements are set as the minimum acceptable level to protect covered defense information. The rule does not preclude a requiring activity from specifically stating in the solicitation that compliance with the NIST SP 800-171 will be used as an evaluation factor in the source section process, and the specifics on how such an evaluation factor would be utilized to evaluate proposals would need to be detailed within the solicitation. However, this is outside of the scope of this rule and would need to be appropriately addressed on an individual solicitation basis.

                         DFARS provision 252.204-7008 ensures that offerors are aware of the safeguarding requirements of DFARS clause 252.204-7012, and provides a process for the offeror to identify situations in which a security requirement in NIST SP 800-171 is not necessary in performance of the contract, or to propose an alternative to a security requirement is NIST SP 800-171. In such cases, the offeror must provide a written explanation in their proposal describing the reasons why a security requirement is not applicable, or how alternative, but equally effective, security measures can compensate for the inability to satisfy a particular requirement. The contracting officer will refer the proposed variance to the DoD CIO for adjudication. The DoD CIO is responsible for ensuring consistent adjudication of proposed non-applicable or alternative security measures. If the DoD CIO needs additional information, a request is made to the contracting officer. Responses are then returned to the contracting officer who, in turn, advises the contractor of the decision. The timeframe for response by the DoD CIO is typically within five business days. The basis for determining if an alternative to a security requirement is acceptable is whether the alternative is equally effective; the basis for determining a security requirement is &ldquo;not applicable&rdquo; is whether the basis or condition for the requirement is absent. While the scope of this rule does not provide for the CIO evaluation to impact the award decision, there is nothing that precludes an activity from drafting the solicitation to provide for this.

DFARS clause 252.204-7012 is flowed down to subcontractors without alteration when performance will involve operationally critical support or covered defense information. However, paragraph (m) of the clause is amended to clarify that the prime contractor shall require subcontractors to notify the prime contractor (or next higher-tier subcontractor) of any requests for variance submitted directly to the contracting officer.

                         Several respondents requested that clarification be provided regarding the requirement that the contractor provide notification to the DoD CIO within 30 days of contract award listing the unmet NIST SP 800-171 security requirements. Respondents asked the following questions: Is the 30-day deadline for the prime contractor's response only, or also for the prime's entire supply base? Would post-award notifications also be required 30 days after award of subcontracts? Should subcontractors submit their notifications directly to the DoD CIO? Can subcontractors also be required to submit copies to the prime contractor? How will these sensitive documents be protected? One respondent asked what is required for the 30-day assessment, if the contract in question ends prior to the December 31, 2017, compliance date. One respondent also suggested that the requirement should be modified to allow at least 90 days after award, and that DoD should allow for a single corporate-wide compliance, and that such a compliance requirement could be accomplished at annual or semi-annual intervals, and not on every single transaction within 30 days.

                         The notification to the DoD CIO of the NIST-SP security requirements not implemented at the time of contract award is a one-time action per contract and is a requirement for contracts awarded prior to October 1, 2017 (see 252.204-7012(b)(2)(ii)(A)). Separately, a contractor may submit requests to vary from a NIST SP 800-171 security requirement (because it is believed to be not applicable or the contractor has an alternative in place) to the contracting officer for adjudication by the DoD CIO (see 252.204-7012(b)(2)(ii)(B)).

                    <p id="p-63" data-page="72991">During the course of performance under the contract, the contractor may manage compliance with the NIST SP 800-171 security requirements through a system security plan. One of the assumptions of NIST SP 800-171 (per table E-12 of the document) is that nonfederal organizations routinely have a system security plan in place to manage and maintain their information systems. When a corrective action is necessary to maintain NIST compliance, a plan of action may be necessary in accordance with NIST 800-171 requirement 3.12. DFARS clause 252.204-7012 is updated at paragraph (b)(3) to clarify that temporary deficiencies with compliance may be addressed within a system security plan.</p>

                         Two respondents commented on the 72-hour reporting requirement. One suggested that the 72-hour reporting requirement is unrealistic unless the rule is revised to limit its applicability to specific information that DoD has provided to the contractor or subcontractor with appropriate markings. One respondent suggested that 72 hours is not enough time to investigate a potential cyber incident, confirm the incident, and obtain the requisite report information. Several respondents commented that the increased reporting requirement to include potentially adverse effects on an information system regardless of an actual compromise to covered defense information, is too burdensome to industry for little apparent benefit, and suggested that DoD eliminate the words &ldquo;or potentially&rdquo; from the definition of cyber incident. One respondent suggested that the rule address what factors contractors should consider when evaluating whether an incident has a &ldquo;potentially adverse effect.&rdquo; One respondent recommended that a threshold be established on when a contractor and subcontractor would be required to report a cyber incident, and that the agency point of contact be a centralized figure/office in which all cyber incident reports are submitted to or, in the alternative, a centralized figure/office that handles reporting for all contracts under which a given contractor performs.

                         When a cyber incident is discovered, the contractor/subcontractor should report whatever information is available to the DIBNet portal within 72 hours of discovery. If the contractor/subcontractor does not have all the information required on the Incident Collection Form (ICF) at the time of the report, and if more information becomes available, the contractor should submit a follow-on report with the added information. The DoD Cyber Crime Center (DC3) serves as the DoD operational focal point for receiving cyber threat and incident reporting from those Defense contractors who have a contractual requirement to report under DFARS clause 252.204-7012.

Many respondents offered alternatives of how to limit access. Several respondents suggested that the final rule use the same use and disclosure rights that were contained in the prior unclassified controlled technical information (UCTI) rule. Others suggested that the rule be modified to state that DoD limit access to equipment or information only in connection with a contractor report of a &ldquo;cyber incident&rdquo; and as necessary to conduct a forensic analysis or damage assessment, adding that the parties should discuss in good faith whether additional information or equipment is necessary. One suggested that the rule indicate that the Government may require access to equipment or information only &ldquo;to determine whether information created by or for the Department in connection with any Department program was successfully exfiltrated from a network or information system and, if so, what information was exfiltrated.&rdquo;

This requirement is implemented in DFARS clause 252.204-7012 by stating that, upon request by DoD, the Contractor shall provide DoD with access to additional information or equipment that is necessary to conduct a forensic analysis&mdash;thus limiting DoD access to equipment/information necessary to conduct the analysis resulting from a cyber incident, as suggested above. This analysis is critical to understand what information was exfiltrated from the information system.

One respondent asked which party determines whether a subcontractor's efforts involve covered defense information or require providing operationally critical support, suggesting that, without additional detail or guidance, the determination of what constitutes covered defense information or operationally critical support would vary. Several respondents requested clarification regarding how DoD intends to enforce the flowdown of DFARS clause 252.204-7012 beyond the first tier of the supply chain, and how subcontractors can comply with the final rule's requirements. One respondent asked DoD to clarify whether it will prohibit a prime contractor from entering into a subcontract if the subcontractor refuses to accept DFARS 252.207-7012. Several respondents commented on the change made to the second interim rule that, when applicable, the clause shall be included without alteration, except to identify the parties, suggesting that this requirement restrains prime contractors' and subcontractors' ability to negotiate flowdown provisions that address the specific needs of their contractual arrangements. Another asked if &ldquo;where DoD requires flow-down without alteration, can industry assume that wherever the language in 252.204-7012 refers to a &ldquo;contractor,&rdquo; the term &ldquo;subcontractor&rdquo; should or can be used in the flowdown version of the clause, except where &ldquo;subcontractor&rdquo; is already used in the clause&rdquo;?

Paragraph (m) is amended in the final rule to clarify that flowdown of the clause is required for subcontracts for operationally critical support, or for which subcontract performance will involve &ldquo;covered defense information,&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;a covered contractor information system.&rdquo; Paragraph (m) is further amended to instruct the contractor to, if necessary, consult with the contracting officer to determine if the information required for subcontractor performance retains its identity as covered defense information and will require protection under this clause, thus driving when the substance of DFARS clause 252.204-7012 must be included in a subcontract. Flowdown is a requirement of the terms of the contract with the Government, which should be enforced by the prime contractor as a result of compliance with these terms. If a subcontractor does not agree to comply with the terms of 252.204-7012, then covered defense information shall not be on that subcontractor's information system.

The respondent suggested that because the cloud computing exemption in DFARS 252.204-7012 is located within the &ldquo;adequate security&rdquo; requirements of the clause, the clause can be read as to impose the Cloud Computing SRG security requirements (included in 252.239-7010) on all cloud information systems, and that different reporting and preservation requirements would apply if the information stored on the CSP's cloud is covered defense information. This respondent further suggested that the scope of DFARS 252.204-7012(b)(1)(A) is defined by the type of service provided, rather than the environment in which information is stored.

                         One respondent commented that it is unclear whether the exemption for security controls contained within DFARS 252.204-7012 covers ancillary cloud services, such as cloud migration and eDiscovery, that a CSP may provide as an add-on service to a cloud computing contract. This respondent suggested that a clarification of the scope of the exemption would be helpful for defining reporting and safeguarding obligations for these providers. One respondent suggested that DoD revise DFARS clause 252.204-7012 to clarify that data stored on a cloud is exempt from the requirements of this clause and subject only to the requirements of DFARS clause 252.239-7010. Such an approach will provide contractors with clear guidelines as to when they are subject to the requirements DFARS 252.204-7012 or DFARS 252.239-7010. Furthermore, through the application of the Cloud Computing SRG requirements to data stored on a cloud, this approach will ensure that DoD information receives the appropriate degree of protection for the environment in which it is stored.

The respondent suggested that these limitations, in which only the customer would know whether an incident impacts a particular customer's data and whether there are additional reporting requirements, drive the need for a two-step reporting requirement that allows the customer who has full knowledge of the data that is stored in the cloud and the applicable classifications of such data to make the ultimate determination of any reporting obligations to the Government.

One comment suggested that the DIBNet cyber reporting requirements should not apply to IaaS providers, but to the prime using the cloud, stating that although IaaS providers will notify the primes of security breaches, they will not have insight into the nature of the data the primes are storing and processing in the infrastructure, or know whether a breach results in a &ldquo;cyber incident,&rdquo; as that term is defined in the clause.

                    <p id="p-115" data-page="72996">The objectives of the rule are to improve information security for DoD information stored on or transiting contractor information systems as well as in a cloud environment. The rule implements section 941 of the NDAA for FY 2013 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/112/public/239" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub.

The only clause within this rule that is implementing the statutory requirements is clause 252.204-7012, which already applied to acquisitions below the simplified acquisition threshold (SAT) and to commercial items, including commercially available off-the-shelf items (COTS). The following addresses the applicability of the new statutory requirements in DFARS clause 252.204-7012.</p>

                    <p id="p-118" data-page="72996">The Director, DPAP, has determined that it is in the best interest of the Government to apply the requirements of section 941 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2013, section 1632 of the NDAA for FY 2015, and section 325 of the Intelligence Authorization Act of FY 2014 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/113/public/126" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 113-126</a>) to contracts at or below the SAT and to contracts for the acquisition of commercial items, for clause 252.204-7012, Safeguarding Covered Defense Information and Cyber Incident Reporting. However, the clause prescription is amended in the final rule to exempt use in solicitations and contracts that are solely for the acquisition of COTS items.</p>
                    <p id="p-119" data-page="72996">The necessity to protect covered defense information is the same across all contract types for all dollar values. The harm that could result from the loss or compromise of covered defense information is the same under a FAR part 12 contract that is under the SAT as it would be under any other contract. Recent high-profile breaches of Federal information show the need to ensure that information security protections are clearly, effectively, and consistently addressed in contracts. Failure to apply this rule to contracts with covered defense information may cause harm to the Government which could directly impact national security. Therefore, exempting contracts below the SAT or for the acquisition of commercial items (excluding COTS items) from application of the statutes would severely decrease the intended effect of the statutes and increase the risk of mission failure.</p>
                    <p id="p-120" data-page="72996">For the same reasons expressed in the preceding paragraph, DoD applied the following provisions and clauses to acquisitions below the SAT and to the acquisition of commercial items, excluding COTS items: (1) DFARS 252.204-7008, Compliance with Safeguarding Covered Defense Information Controls; (2) DFARS 252.204-7009, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Third-Party Contractor Information; (3) DFARS 252.239-7009, Representation of Use of Cloud Computing; and (4) DFARS 252.239-7010, Cloud Computing Services.</p>

                         Respondents expressed concern that the estimated of the total number of small businesses impacted by the rule is too low and that the rule does not allow for alternative standards or exemption for small business due to potentially burdensome costs of compliance.

                        <em>Response:</em>
                         As there is no database collecting the number of contractors receiving covered defense information it is difficult to determine how many contractors are required to implement the security requirements of clause 252.204-7012, Safeguarding Covered Defense Information and Cyber Incident Reporting. Further, without adding a new information collection requirement to prime contractors it is not possible to determine how many subcontractors are in possession of covered defense information. Based on the respondent's analysis of the number of small entities, as prime contractors and as subcontractors, that may be affected by the rule the DoD estimate of small entities affected by this rule has been revised, to increase the number.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-128" data-page="72997">The cost of compliance with the requirements of this rule is unknown as the cost is determined based on the make-up of the information system and the current state of security already in place. If a contractor is already in compliance with the 2013 version of the clause 252.204-7012, then the changes necessary to comply with the new rule are not as significant. For a new contractor that has not been subject to the previous iteration of the 252.204-7012 clause and is now handling covered defense information the cost could be significant to comply. The cost of compliance is allowable and should be accounted for in proposal pricing (in accordance with the entity's accounting practices). Though it is not a change specific to small entities the security requirements as amended in this rule are found in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-171, &ldquo;Protecting Controlled Unclassified information in Nonfederal Information Systems and organizations,&rdquo; to replace a table based on NIST SP 800-53. The security requirements in NIST SP 800-171 are specifically tailored for use in protecting sensitive information residing in contractor information systems and generally reduce the burden placed on contractors by eliminating Federal-centric processes and requirements and enabling contractors to use systems they already have in place with some modification instead of building a new system.</p>
                    <p id="p-129" data-page="72997">Recommendations made by public comment to allow for alternative application of the rule for small entities include: An exemption for small entities, delaying application to small entities until costs are further analyzed, and creating a different set of security requirements for small entities. While all of these paths were considered, they were rejected as conflicting with the overarching purpose of this rule which is to increase the security of unclassified information that DoD has determined could result in harm if released. Regardless of the size of the contractor or subcontractor handling the information, the protection level of that information needs to be the same across the board to achieve the goal of increased information assurance.</p>

This respondent also commented that the cost of compliance with the rule will be a significant barrier to small businesses engaging in the Federal acquisition process, adding that many small businesses will be forced to purchase services and additional software from outside or third-party vendors in order to provide &ldquo;adequate safeguards&rdquo; for covered defense information and to adequately assess and evaluate their information systems and security controls.

                         The final rule clarifies that the protections are not required when contracting solely for COTS items, thereby reducing the impact on some small business. The need to protect covered defense information does not change when such information is shared with nonfederal partners including small businesses. The cost of not protecting covered defense information is an enormous detriment to DoD resulting in a potential loss or compromise of such information, adverse impacts to the DoD warfighting mission, and to the lives of service men and women.

                         As noted in response to the same public comment, DoD revises the estimate to be 12,000 small business prime contractors and any small business subcontractors that will be required to handle covered defense information during performance of the subcontracted work. There is currently no system to track when covered defense information is present on contract or passed to subcontractors so this estimate is not made with a high level of certainty.

                         While it is understood that implementing the minimum security controls outlined in the DFARs clause may increase costs, protection of unclassified DoD information is deemed necessary. The cost to the nation in lost intellectual property and lost technological advantage over potential adversaries is much greater than these initial/ongoing investments. The value of the information (and impact of its loss) does not diminish when it moves to contractors (prime or sub, large or small). NIST SP 800-171 was carefully crafted to use performance-based requirements and eliminate unnecessary specificity and include only those security requirements necessary to provide adequate protections for the impact level of CUI (
                        <em>e.g.,</em>
                         covered defense information).
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-137" data-page="72997">Implementation of the NIST SP 800-171 security requirements will provide significant benefit to the small business community in the form of increased protection of their intellectual property. In addition, defining one set of standards will help small businesses to avoid a situation in which small business must adopt multiple standards and rule sets as they navigate amongst the many different organizations with which they do business. The addition of a new provision at DFARS 252.204-7008, Compliance with Safeguarding Covered Defense Information Controls, ensures that the offeror is aware of the requirements of clause 252.204-7012 and has time to bring their system into compliance and negotiate the terms of the contract accordingly.</p>

                         There is no funding appropriation attached to compliance with the rule so it is not feasible to create a program for compliance or a one-time subsidy related to the new security requirements associated with the rule. However, the costs associated with compliance are allowable and should be considered in proposals on solicitations including the 252.204-7008 provision and 252.204-7012 clause, when covered defense information is present. The final rule is amended to require the security requirements to be in place only when the covered defense information is marked or identified in the contract, which should cut down significantly on the number of contractors that mistakenly assumed they were required to comply.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-140" data-page="72998">DoD has revised the estimate to be 12,000 small business prime contractors; however, the number of small business subcontractors that will be required to handle covered defense information during performance of the subcontracted work cannot be accurately estimated. Which small businesses will be required to comply, is entirely dependent on the work that they perform and the unclassified information involved. If they work solely in COTS items, then they will be exempt from the security requirements.</p>
                    <p id="p-141" data-page="72998">This rule requires that contractors report cyber incidents to the Government in accordance with DFARS clause 252.204-7012. An information technology expert will likely be required to provide information describing the cyber incident in the report, or at least to determine what information was affected.</p>
                    <p id="p-142" data-page="72998">For the final rule the prescriptions for provision 252.204-7008 and 252.204-7012 are amended to exempt COTS items, to clarify that they do not apply to contracts that are solely for COTS items. The final rule will keep the subcontractor flowdown requirement as amended in the second interim rule to only require the clause to flowdown when the covered defense information has been provided to the subcontractor, and this will significantly decrease the amount of small subcontractors that are unnecessarily working toward compliance with the security requirements of clause 252.204-7012.</p>
