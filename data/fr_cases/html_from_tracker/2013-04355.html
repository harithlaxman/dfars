                    DoD published an interim rule in the

                    29, 2012, to implement sections 368 and 821 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/112/public/81" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 112-81</a>). Section 368 requires award of contracts that provide the best value, when acquiring tents and other temporary structures, regardless of whether purchased by DoD or by another agency on behalf of DoD. Section 821 amends <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2533a" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2533a</a> (the &ldquo;Berry Amendment&rdquo;) to extend the restriction requiring acquisition of domestic tents to include the structural components of tents, applicable to acquisitions that exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.

                <p id="p-8" data-page="13545">Although no written public comments were received, DoD has amended the final rule as follows in response to verbal questions, which indicated possible misinterpretation of the interim rule.</p>
                <h3 id="h-9">A. Tents and Structural Components of Tents </h3>
                <p id="p-9" data-page="13545">
                    <em>Question:</em>
                     Does the term &ldquo;structural components&rdquo; apply just to tents, or also to tarpaulins and covers?
                </p>
                <p id="p-10" data-page="13545">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The vertical listing of the items at 225.7002-1(a)(3) and 252.225-7012(b)(3) ensures clarity that the phrase &ldquo;structural components&rdquo; only applies to tents and not also to tarpaulins and covers.
                </p>
                <h3 id="h-10">B. Best Value When Acquiring Tents and Other Temporary Structures</h3>
                <p id="p-11" data-page="13545">
                    <em>Question:</em>
                     Does the Berry Amendment now apply to temporary structures?
                </p>
                <p id="p-12" data-page="13545">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The interim rule addressed at DFARS 225.7002-1(a)(3)(i) the requirement to award contracts that provide best value, when acquiring tents and other temporary structures. DFARS 225.7002-1 implements the domestic source restrictions of the Berry Amendment (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2533a" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2533a</a>). However, temporary structures are not covered under the Berry Amendment. Therefore, this requirement relating to best value has been moved to DFARS 215.101, supplementing FAR 15.101, Best value continuum. This will remove any implication that temporary structures are covered by the Berry Amendment.
                </p>
                <h2 id="h-11">III. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563</h2>
                <p id="p-13" data-page="13545">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has determined that this is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993. This rule is not a major rule under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/804" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 804</a>.</p>
                <h2 id="h-12">IV. Regulatory Flexibility Act</h2>
                <p id="p-14" data-page="13545">
                    DoD does not expect this final rule to have a significant  economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>, 
                    <em>et seq.</em>
                     However, a final regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared and is summarized as follows:
                </p>
                <p id="p-15" data-page="13545">The objectives of this final rule are to&mdash;</p>
                
            <ul class="bullets" >
          <li id="p-16" data-page="13545">Require that contracts for the acquisition of tents and other temporary structures provide best value, regardless of whether purchased by DoD or by another agency on behalf of DoD; and</li>
                <li id="p-17" data-page="13545">Extend the domestic source restriction of<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2533a" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2533a</a> (the &ldquo;Berry Amendment&rdquo;) to cover the structural components of tents, in order to promote the use of domestic materials and enhance growth of the United States economy.</li>
            </ul>
          
                <p id="p-18" data-page="13545">The legal basis for this final rule is sections 368 and 821 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/112/public/81" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 112-81</a>). The requirement to award contracts that provide best value to the Government does not have any impact on small business entities, because that is already a general requirement for all acquisitions.</p>
                <p id="p-19" data-page="13545">The domestic source restriction on the structural components of tents does not apply below the simplified acquisition threshold. This restriction may affect approximately 40 or fewer small business concerns at the prime contract level. Review of the Fiscal Year 2011 data on acquisition of items with product or service code 8340 (tents or tarpaulins) identified 49 actions with small business concerns (contracts or orders), estimated value of $48.6 million, of which about 10 percent appeared to be for other than tents (e.g., prefabricated metal buildings and components, metal household furnishings, or electrical equipment). The Federal Procurement Data System does not provide data on components, so it is not known the extent to which the providers of tents currently utilize domestic or foreign structural components. An exception may be granted if a component is domestically nonavailable. However, this rule promotes the use of domestic components, and should, therefore, be favorable to small entities that provide domestic structural components of tents. The requirements of the rule for use of domestic components will not apply below the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>
                <p id="p-20" data-page="13545">This rule does not impose any reporting or recordkeeping requirements. The rule does not duplicate, overlap, or conflict with any other Federal rules.</p>
                <p id="p-21" data-page="13545">DoD did not identify any significant alternatives that would accomplish the stated objectives of the statute. The rule specifically implements the statutory requirement.</p>
                <h2 id="h-13">V. Paperwork Reduction Act</h2>
                <p id="p-22" data-page="13545">The rule does not contain any information collection requirements that require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/44/3501" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44 U.S.C. chapter 35</a>).</p>
