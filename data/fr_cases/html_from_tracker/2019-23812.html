                    A final regulatory flexibility analysis (FRFA) has been prepared consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>, 
                    <em>et seq.</em>
                     The FRFA is summarized as follows:
                </p>
                <p id="p-15" data-page="58333">This final rule is necessary to implement section 834 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2018. Section 834 of the NDAA for FY 2018 amends Title 10, United States Code, to add section 2443, Sustainment factors in weapon system design. Section 2443 requires program managers or comparable requiring activity officials, exercising program management responsibilities, to ensure that reliability and maintainability are included in the performance attributes of the key performance parameters on sustainment during the development of capabilities requirements for major weapon systems design and contracts for the technical maturation and risk reduction and engineering and manufacturing development of a weapon system, including embedded software; or production of a weapon system. The objective of this final rule is to implement section 834 of the NDAA for FY 2018.</p>
                <p id="p-16" data-page="58333">There were no issues raised by the public in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis provided in the proposed rule.</p>
                <p id="p-17" data-page="58333">The final rule will apply to all small entities that have been or will be awarded contracts for the development of major weapon systems. Small business statistics were obtained from the Federal Procurement Data System for FY 2018 data identifying the DoD research and development engineering development awards issued, including task and delivery orders under single-award indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contracts and Basic Ordering Agreements as of February 26, 2019. Of the 78 contract awards, 15 awards or approximately 19 percent were made to unique small business entities.</p>
                <p id="p-18" data-page="58333">This rule does not include any new reporting, recordkeeping, or other compliance requirements for small businesses.</p>
                <p id="p-19" data-page="58333">There are no known significant alternative approaches to the proposed rule that would meet the proposed objectives of the statute.</p>

                <p id="p-20" data-page="58333">The rule does not contain any information collection requirements that require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/44/3501" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44 U.S.C. chapter 35</a>).</p>
