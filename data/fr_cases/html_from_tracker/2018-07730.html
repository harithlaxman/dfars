References in DFARS clause 252.219-7004 to the &ldquo;Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number&rdquo; are revised to read &ldquo;unique entity identifier&rdquo;. Paragraph headers are added at DFARS 219.702-70(a) and 252.219-7004(b) and (e).</p>
                <h2 id="h-12">III. Applicability to Contracts at or Below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold and for Commercial Items, Including Commercially Available Off-the-Shelf Items</h2>
                <p id="p-22" data-page="15997">This rule applies the requirements of section 821 of the NDAA for FY 2015 to contracts for the acquisition of commercial items, including commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) items. The rule is not applicable to the contracts at or below the simplified acquisition threshold. Accordingly, the Director, DPAP, has signed a determination and finding to apply this rule to contracts for the acquisition of commercial items, including COTS items, for DFARS clauses 252.219-7003, Small Business Subcontracting Plan (DoD Contracts), and 252.219-7004, Small Business Subcontracting Plan (Test Program).</p>
                <h2 id="h-13">IV. Expected Cost Savings</h2>
                <p id="p-23" data-page="15997">This final rule amends the DFARS to implement section 821 of the NDAA for FY 2015, section 872 of the NDAA for FY 2016, and section 826 of NDAA for FY 2017, all of which provide revisions to the Test Program for Negotiation of Comprehensive Small Business Subcontracting Plans. Section 826 extended the Test Program through December 31, 2027.</p>
                <p id="p-24" data-page="15997">Customarily, an individual small business subcontracting plan is required to be negotiated by large business firms for each contract above $700,000. Under the Test Program, participants negotiate a comprehensive subcontracting plan (CSP) to cover all applicable contacts, in lieu of providing a separate plan for each individual contract. To be eligible for the Test Program, the program participants are required to be accepted into the program and to have at least three DoD contracts during the preceding year with an aggregate value of at least $100 million. There are currently nine large business firms that are currently participating in the Test Program. The CSPs for these nine large businesses cover approximately 8,000 contracts.</p>
                <p id="p-25" data-page="15997">This rule revises DFARS clause 252.219-7004, Small Business Subcontracting Plan (Test Program), to require the nine Test Program participants to report, on a semiannual basis, specific information related to their CSPs. This information is expected to assist DoD in determining if the participants have achieved cost savings while enhancing opportunities for small businesses. Contracting officers conduct compliance reviews each year; and, if it is determined that the contractor failed to make a good faith effort to comply with the CSPs, the contracting officer may assess liquidated damages. Any failure to meet negotiated goals will also be considered as part of the evaluation of the participant firm's past performance. However, very few, if any, failures are expected in the Test Program.</p>
                <p id="p-26" data-page="15997">Over the next 10 years, significant cost savings are expected to accrue to the public and the Government through use of CSPs by greatly reducing administrative burdens, while also advancing the interests of small business subcontractors. Use of CSPs may also foster an environment that provides visibility to a firm of its overall subcontracting program, thereby potentially providing greater opportunities to ensure equitable consideration on an enterprise-wide basis for business opportunities for all its subcontractors.</p>
                <p id="p-27" data-page="15997">DoD has performed a regulatory cost analysis on this rule. The following is a summary of the estimated public annualized cost savings in millions, calculated in 2016 dollars at a 7-percent discount rate in perpetuity:</p>

                <p id="p-29" data-page="15997">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. The Office of Management and Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, has determined that this is not a significant regulatory action as defined under section 3(f) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a> and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b). This rule is not a major rule under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/804" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 804(2)</a>.</p>

                    A final regulatory flexibility analysis (FRFA) has been prepared consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>,

                <p id="p-32" data-page="15998">DoD is issuing a final rule to amend the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) to implement section 821 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/113/public/291" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub.

L. 114-328</a>). Section 821 of the NDAA for FY 2015 provides several changes to the Test Program for Negotiation of Comprehensive Small Business Subcontracting Plans (Test Program), including new reporting and eligibility requirements, an extension of the Test Program, and authority to assess liquidated damages. Section 872 of the NDAA for FY 2016 removes one of the eligibility requirements. Section 826 of the NDAA for FY 2017 extends the Test Program through December 31, 2027. The objectives of this rule are to collect data to assist in assessing the successes or shortcomings of the Test Program and to provide the means to hold Test Program participants accountable for failure to make a good faith effort to comply with their comprehensive subcontracting plans.</p>
                <p id="p-33" data-page="15998">There were no issues raised by the public in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis provided in the proposed rule.</p>
                <p id="p-34" data-page="15998">The rule will not apply to small entities. Therefore, the rule does not impose any reporting or recordkeeping requirements on any small entities.</p>
                <p id="p-35" data-page="15998">DoD has not identified any alternatives that are consistent with the stated objectives of the applicable statutes. However, DoD notes that the rule may have a positive economic impact on small entities because the rule encourages Test Program participants to make a good faith effort to comply with their comprehensive subcontracting plans.</p>
