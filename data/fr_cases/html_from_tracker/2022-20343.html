                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         Two respondents expressed concern regarding the changes to the women-owned small business (WOSB) certification process, indicating it is overly complex and is a barrier to entry into the Federal marketplace for WOSB concerns. One respondent also indicated that the new process will extend award times by requiring contracting officers to check the Dynamic Small Business Search (DSBS) to verify the certification status of WOSB concerns.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-12" data-page="58238">
                        <em>Response:</em>
                         This rule implements SBA's final rule at <a href="/citation/85-FR-27650" class="fr-reference" data-reference="85 FR 27650">85 FR 27650</a>, issued on May 11, 2020, implementing section 825(a)(1) of the NDAA for FY 2015, which amended <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/15/637" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15 U.S.C. 637(m)</a>. In its final rule, SBA amended <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-13/part-127" class="cfr external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">13 CFR part 127</a> to require WOSB and EDWOSB concerns to be certified by SBA or an SBA-approved third-party certifier in accordance with <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-13/section-127.300" class="cfr external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">13 CFR 127.300</a>. The statutory language mandates the methods for certification; therefore, SBA has no authority to retain representation as an option for concerns seeking to compete for WOSB and EDWOSB sole-source and set-aside procurements. The WOSB and EDWOSB certification requirement applies only to those businesses wishing to compete for set-aside or sole-source contracts under the WOSB Program (the Program). Other WOSB concerns that do not participate in the Program may continue to represent their status and receive contract awards outside the Program. This rule does not change existing documentation requirements for certification. WOSBs will submit the documentation to SBA through 
                        <em>certify.SBA.gov</em>
                         or to SBA-approved third-party certifiers. In addition, a concern's status will appear in the System for Award Management (SAM); therefore, this rule will not delay award since contracting officers are already required to verify contractor information in SAM prior to award.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent indicated that the Background section of the proposed rule incorrectly stated that WOSBs would be able to be certified by State governments and that this statement did not align with the FAR text of the proposed rule and SBA's final rule. The respondent indicated that SBA's final rule implementing section 825(a)(1) of the NDAA for FY 2015 does not authorize WOSB and EDWOSB concerns to be certified by a State government. The respondent indicated that the proposed rule FAR text accurately captures the program requirements as implemented by SBA.

                         The Councils acknowledge the inaccuracy of the statement included in the background section of the proposed rule and clarify that WOSB and EDWOSB concerns are certified by SBA or a SBA-approved third-party certifier.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent indicated that the proposed rule's language at FAR 19.1503(c) differs from SBA's regulations regarding when a contracting officer must, or may, terminate a contract.

The questioned phrase &ldquo;the contracting officer may terminate&rdquo; already appears at FAR 19.1503(e), and is only being renumbered as paragraph (c).

Additionally, the law is silent on the applicability of this requirement to acquisitions of COTS items and does not independently provide for criminal or civil penalties; nor does it include terms making express reference to <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1907" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1907</a> and its application to acquisitions of COTS items. Therefore, it does not apply to acquisition of COTS items unless the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy makes a written determination as provided at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1907" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1907</a>.</p>

                        Failure to apply section 825(a)(1) to acquisitions at or below the SAT, acquisitions of commercial products or commercial services, including COTS items, would prevent contracting officers from using WOSB set-asides or making sole-source awards to WOSB or EDWOSB concerns based on their socioeconomic status. This limitation would restrict opportunities for WOSB and EDWOSB concerns in the Federal marketplace which is contrary to the longstanding policy expressed in FAR 19.201 of promoting &ldquo;maximum practicable opportunities&rdquo; in Government contracting, as well as the Administration's express commitment reflected in <a href="/executive-order/13985" class="eo">Executive Order 13985</a>,

                    <p id="p-35" data-page="58239">As a result of this rule, contracting officers will be required to check SAM to determine if an EDWOSB or WOSB concern is certified or if the concern has a pending application for certification in DSBS, instead of checking that all required documentation has been submitted to the now defunct WOSB Repository. For EDWOSB or WOSB set-asides and sole-source awards, awards can only be made to an EDWOSB or WOSB certified concern. For EDWOSB or WOSB set-aside awards, if the apparently successful offeror's EDWOSB or WOSB certification is pending, the contracting officer will be required to notify SBA's Director/Government Contracting, and request SBA's status determination. Within 15 calendar days from the date of contracting officer notification, SBA will make a determination regarding the offeror's status as an EDWOSB or WOSB eligible under the WOSB program. If SBA does not provide the contracting officer with a determination within 15 days, the contracting officer may provide SBA additional time to make a determination, or may proceed with award to the next highest evaluated offeror.</p>

In addition, the SBA final rule advises concerns that only a certified WOSB or EDWOSB may seek a specific sole-source requirement under the Program and that only a certified WOSB or EDWOSB, or a concern that has a pending application for certification under the Program may submit an offer on a specific EDWOSB or WOSB set-aside requirement.</p>

The FRFA is summarized as follows:</p>
                    
                        <p id="p-42" data-page="58240">DoD, GSA, and NASA are issuing a final rule amending the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to implement section 825(a)(1) of the Carl Levin and Howard P. &ldquo;Buck&rdquo; McKeon National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/113/public/291" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 113-291</a>) which amended <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/15/637" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15 U.S.C. 637(m)</a>, and SBA's final rule at <a href="/citation/85-FR-27650" class="fr-reference" data-reference="85 FR 27650">85 FR 27650</a> issued on May 11, 2020, to require that women-owned small business (WOSBs) concerns and economically disadvantaged women-owned small business (EDWOSBs) concerns participating in the WOSB Program (the Program) be certified by SBA or by a SBA-approved third-party certifier. EDWOSB and WOSB concerns that are not certified will not be eligible for contracts under the Program. The certification requirement applies only to participants wishing to compete for set-aside or sole-source contracts under the Program. EDWOSB and WOSB concerns that do not participate in the Program may continue to represent their status, receive contract awards outside the Program, and the awards may count toward an agency's goal for awards to WOSBs.</p>
                        <p id="p-43" data-page="58240">There were no significant issues raised by the public comments in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis.</p>
                        <p id="p-44" data-page="58240">This rule will require EDWOSB and WOSB concerns to apply for certification through SBA or a SBA-approved third-party certifier and to be certified in order to be eligible for WOSB or EDWOSB set-aside or sole-source contracts under the Program. This rule is anticipated to impact 9,000-12,000 WOSB concerns. This estimate reflects the approximate number of WOSB concerns in the predecessor system SBA used to maintain WOSB certifications. The assumption is that the majority of those entities will seek certification from SBA or a third-party under the new certification process.</p>
                        <p id="p-45" data-page="58240">Data taken from the Federal Procurement Data System as of February 8, 2022, revealed that 8,599 set-aside or sole-source awards were made to WOSB and EDWOSB concerns from FY 2019 to FY 2021. Of the 8,599 awards made, 625 or approximately 7 percent, were WOSB and EDWOSB sole-source awards. This exemplifies the number of opportunities an offeror would potentially miss out on if they are not a certified EDWOSB or WOSB concern.</p>
                        <p id="p-46" data-page="58240">This final rule does not impose any new reporting, recordkeeping, or other compliance requirements for small entities.</p>
                        <p id="p-47" data-page="58240">The Small Business Administration currently collects information to carry out its statutory mandate to provide oversight of certification related to SBA's WOSB Federal Contract Program (OMB Control Number 3245-0374, Certification for the Women-Owned Small Business Federal Contract Program). Certified EDWOSB or WOSB concerns need to update their certification information with SBA once a year to maintain their status with the WOSB Federal Contract program.</p>
                        <p id="p-48" data-page="58240">There are no known significant alternative approaches to the final rule.</p>
