                    DoD published a proposed rule in the 
                    <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                     at <a href="/citation/88-FR-25609" class="fr-reference" data-reference="88 FR 25609">88 FR 25609</a> on April 27, 2023, to implement section 844 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/116/public/283" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 116-283</a>). Section 844 amends <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2533c" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2533c</a> (redesignated <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/4872" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 4872</a>) and removes from the restriction &ldquo;material melted&rdquo; and replaces it with &ldquo;material mined, refined, separated, melted&rdquo;. In addition, the reference to &ldquo;tungsten&rdquo; is removed and replaced with &ldquo;covered material&rdquo; in the exception for commercially available-off-the-shelf (COTS) items to the restriction of 50 percent or more by weight. The final rule also implements section 854 of the NDAA for FY 2024 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/118/public/31" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 118-31</a>) that amends the effective date in section 844(b) of the NDAA for FY 2021. Section 854 extends the effective date of the restriction from 5 years to 6 years. Nine respondents submitted public comments in response to the proposed rule.

                <p id="p-9" data-page="46816">Revisions were made at DFARS 225.7018-2 to implement the new effective date of the restriction in accordance with section 854 of the NDAA for FY 2024. Consequently, the dates of the current restrictions were revised to provide an effective date through December 31, 2026, and to reflect that the new restrictions will be effective on January 1, 2027. Conforming revisions were also made in the DFARS clause at 252.225-7052, Restriction on the Acquisition of Certain Magnets, Tantalum, and Tungsten.</p>

                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     Most respondents strongly supported the proposed rule. A few respondents stated that implementation of the restriction will help to strengthen domestic supply chains and help to establish secure domestic sourcing requirements. A respondent conveyed support for the rule and provided the restriction will contribute to the redevelopment of domestic rare earth production capacity.

                    <em>Response:</em>
                     Implementation of the statutory sourcing requirements in accordance with <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2533c" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2533c</a> (now <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/4872" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 4872</a>), as amended by section 844 of the NDAA for FY 2021, is a necessary step to support the development of secure suppliers and transition defense critical supply chains to secure sources. DoD has supported the effective implementation of the statutory sourcing requirements through existing and planned investments in compliant suppliers. If compliant suppliers are not available for specified applications, the statute authorizes DoD to issue a nonavailability determination until a compliant supplier becomes available.
                </p>
                <h4 id="h-15">b. Samarium-Cobalt (Sm-Co) Magnets</h4>
                <p id="p-16" data-page="46817">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     A respondent specified that it is the only U.S.-based, vertically integrated domestic supplier of samarium cobalt magnets and discussed the impacts of their current rare earth metals supplier and its subsequent foreign ownership status. The respondent further states that they have spoken to potential domestic rare earth metal suppliers and their transition to becoming a domestic supplier is in its infancy at best.
                </p>
                <p id="p-17" data-page="46817">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     Implementation of the statutory sourcing requirements, in coordination with existing and planned DoD investments in the rare earth magnet supply chain, will support the development of compliant suppliers for rare earth concentrates, oxides, metals, and magnets. If compliant suppliers are not available for specified applications, the statute authorizes DoD to issue a nonavailability determination until a compliant supplier becomes available. DoD notes that the statute permits sourcing from domestic suppliers as well as suppliers located in other countries that source outside of the four covered countries: North Korea, Russia, Iran, or the People's Republic of China.

                <p id="p-18" data-page="46817">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     Many respondents relayed their overall concerns with the Chinese rare earth metals market dominance and the associated national security risks.
                </p>
                <p id="p-19" data-page="46817">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The principal benefit of this rule is that it continues the transition of the defense industrial base toward sourcing strategic and critical materials from suppliers other than the covered countries of North Korea, Russia, Iran, and the People's Republic of China. This requirement, in combination with existing and planned DoD investments, demonstrates DoD's commitment to support secure suppliers and to reduce the national security risks associated with over-reliance on, and the dominance of, the Chinese market.
                </p>
                <h4 id="h-17">5. Effective Date of Restriction</h4>
                <p id="p-20" data-page="46817">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     A few respondents expressed concern that domestic sources would not be available by the effective dates established in the rule. A respondent specifically recommended DoD advocate that Congress amend the statute to replace the specific effective dates with, instead, an effective date 180 days after the Secretary of Defense certifies to Congress that sufficient domestic sources are available to meet DoD's needs.
                </p>
                <p id="p-21" data-page="46817">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     Section 844(b) of the NDAA for FY 2021, as amended by section 854 of the NDAA for FY 2024, expressly states the effective date of the restrictions. As such, DoD cannot implement any other effective dates. DoD notes that section 854 extends the effective date of the restriction by one additional year to January 1, 2027. The restriction at DFARS 225.7018-2 reflects the statutory effective date as a clear demand signal and timetable to DoD's industry partners. DoD encourages industry to diligently seek and develop compliant domestic sources by the stated effective dates.

                <h4 id="h-18">6. Recycled Material Exception</h4>
                <p id="p-22" data-page="46817">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     A respondent inquired about the applicability of the restriction to an end item containing a covered material that is a neodymium-iron-boron magnet manufactured from recycled material if the milling of the recycled material and sintering of the final magnet takes place in the United States. The respondent recommends DoD consider the same recycled material exception to be applied to the other magnets subject to the statutory restriction.
                </p>
                <p id="p-23" data-page="46817">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The statutory requirements for exceptions in <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/4872" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 4872(c)(3)(C)</a> state that the restriction under subsection (a) does not apply to the purchase by DoD of an end item containing a covered material that is a neodymium-iron-boron magnet manufactured from recycled material if the milling of the recycled material and sintering of the final magnet takes place in the United States. The section 844 amendments to <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2533c" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2533c</a> (now <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/4872" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 4872</a>) did not add exceptions for the remaining covered materials, defined in the statute.

                <p id="p-24" data-page="46817">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     A few respondents expressed support for the rule but highlighted specific areas for further consideration by DoD. A respondent welcomed the revision of the exception to the restriction to include COTS items that are 50 percent or more by weight to all covered items, including but no longer limited to only tungsten. However, the respondent opined that implementing this change would be problematic because of a lack of consistent methodology to determine whether an item qualifies for the exception. Another respondent expressed support for the proposed change because it would reduce foreign influence in America's critical mineral supply chain. However, the respondent also commented that the restriction should be expanded to include other critical mineral products, specifically cobalt metal powder and refined cobalt.
                </p>
                <p id="p-25" data-page="46817">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     DoD understands that cobalt metal powder is part of the samarium-cobalt magnet supply chain and will be subject to this statutory restriction. The rule implements section 844 of the NDAA for FY 2021, which replaces the reference to &ldquo;tungsten&rdquo; with &ldquo;covered material&rdquo; in the exception for COTS items to the restriction of 50 percent or more by weight. When identifying whether the COTS items exception applies to the end item, DoD encourages industry to consult the relevant procuring activity for the acquisition on how best to demonstrate compliance to the exception. DoD expects industry to use a reasonable and reliable process to determine an end item's composition and weight.
                </p>
                <p id="p-26" data-page="46817">In regard to further expanding the restriction to include cobalt metal powder and refined cobalt, the statutory restriction includes, for samarium-cobalt magnets, the entire supply chain from mining or production of a cobalt and samarium ore, through production of finished magnets.

                    are verified. Another respondent recommended use of the same process created for a nonavailability determination under the specialty metals requirements and the current waiver process to allow for the use of noncompliant materials in case of a shortage. Additionally, the respondent recommends the ability for contractors and subcontractors to request nonavailability determinations, a public notice of the requests, and a process for manufacturers to demonstrate compliance and the ability to supply materials.

                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The DFARS authorizes DoD to issue both individual and class nonavailability determinations if compliant materials are unavailable, as stated at DFARS 225.7018-4. The nonavailability determination process for this statute is largely aligned with the existing nonavailability determination process for specialty metals in accordance with <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/4863" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 4863</a> (see 225.7003-3).
                </p>
                <p id="p-29" data-page="46818">The statutory sourcing requirement is important to transition supply chains to secure suppliers of strategic and critical materials. The existing regulations authorize DoD to issue individual and class nonavailability determinations if needed for national security in cases where compliant materials are not available. The process for class nonavailability determinations also provides opportunity for interested parties and manufacturers to provide information to DoD regarding the availability of compliant materials that would be relevant to the decision.</p>
                <p id="p-30" data-page="46818">As provided at DFARS 225.7018-4, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (USD(A&amp;S)) must issue a public notice of the intent to make a class nonavailability determination at least 30 days prior to issuing the nonavailability determination, to the maximum extent practicable consistent with the protection of national security. Following the public notice, interested parties, including producers of covered materials, may provide relevant information. The USD(A&amp;S) will take the information provided into consideration when determining whether to issue a class nonavailability determination. When issuing the final class nonavailability determination, the USD(A&amp;S) will ensure that the class nonavailability determination and supporting rationale will be made publicly available, consistent with the protection of national security and confidential business information.</p>

                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     A respondent stated that it will be problematic to implement the COTS items exception to the restriction of 50 percent or more by weight that includes all &ldquo;covered material&rdquo; as now defined in <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/4872" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 4872</a> in accordance with section 844 of the NDAA for FY 2021. The respondent further recommended that clarification in the rule is required to provide a consistent methodology for contractors to determine qualification criteria under the exception in the DFARS clause 252.225-7052 at paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A)(
                    <em>1</em>), although a respondent acknowledged statutory changes would be required to effect this recommendation. Additionally, a respondent commented that removing the COTS items exception and including the entire and most remote aspects of the supply chain represents a nearly inexecutable burden for companies to manage.

                    <em>Response:</em>
                     Section 844 is silent on applicability to contracts and subcontracts for the acquisition of commercial products and commercial services.

                     A respondent recommends creation of a centralized DoD certification process, a trusted marketplace of commercial suppliers, or a qualified list of compliant sources to facilitate the transition across the defense industrial base for future compliance with the statutory restriction.

                     The creation of a compliant supplier list is outside the scope of the rule. While DoD may explore the potential feasibility of developing a list for this application, in general, DoD does not support establishing a list of preferred sourcing.

                <h2 id="h-24">III. Applicability to Contracts at or Below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT), for Commercial Products (Including Commercially Available Off-the-Shelf (COTS) Items), and for Commercial Services</h2>
                <p id="p-39" data-page="46818">This rule amends the clause at DFARS 252.225-7052, Restriction on the Acquisition of Certain Magnets, Tantalum, and Tungsten. However, this final rule does not impose any new requirements on contracts at or below the SAT, for commercial products including COTS items. DFARS 252.225-7052 does not apply to acquisitions below the SAT, in accordance with <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1905" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1905</a>, but it applies to contracts for the acquisition of commercial products, including COTS items, except as provided in the statute at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/4872" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 4872(c)(3)</a>.</p>

                <p id="p-40" data-page="46818">This rule will impact the Government and industry because this rule significantly expands the scope of compliance in accordance with section 844 of the NDAA for FY 2021, section 854 of the FY 2024 NDAA, and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/4872" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 4872</a>.</p>
                <p id="p-41" data-page="46818">
                    The current restriction at DFARS 225.7018-2 covers the melting of precursor metals (
                    <em>e.g.,</em>
                     samarium metal and cobalt metal) to produce alloys (
                    <em>e.g.,</em>
                     samarium-cobalt alloy) and other equivalent processes (
                    <em>e.g.,</em>
                     atomization, calcination and reduction, or final consolidation of non-melt derived metals powders). One of the materials covered by this rule at 225.7018-2 and the clause at DFARS 252.225-7052, Restriction on the Acquisition of Certain Magnets, Tantalum, and Tungsten, is also covered by longstanding restrictions for the acquisition of specialty metals at 225.7003-2 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/4875" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 4875</a>) and under the clause at DFARS 252.225-7009, Restriction on Acquisition of Specialty Metals, that includes the same coverage of production steps (
                    <em>e.g.,</em>
                     melt or produce).
                </p>
                <p id="p-42" data-page="46818">
                    This rule expands the scope of product coverage to all upstream mining, refining, separation, and melting of covered materials. Taken together with the overlapping restriction requirement on specialty metals at 225.7003-2 and the clause at DFARS 252.225-7009, Restriction on Acquisition of Specialty Metals, covered materials that are compliant with the

                    specialty metals clause may not be compliant with the current restriction at DFARS 225.7018-2 or the clause at DFARS 252.225-7052, Restriction on the Acquisition of Certain Magnets, Tantalum, and Tungsten, nor are they likely to be compliant with this rule.
                </p>
                <p id="p-43" data-page="46819">For example, assume that a contractor purchases a component from a United Kingdom-based supplier, and the assembly contains a samarium-cobalt magnet manufactured in China. This component would be compliant with the specialty metals clause, because the specialty metals clause exempts qualifying country components. However, this rule has no exemption for qualifying country components, and thus the assembly would be noncompliant with the current restriction at DFARS 225.7018-2 and the clause at DFARS 252.225-7052, Restriction on the Acquisition of Certain Magnets, Tantalum, and Tungsten, in its current form and as amended by this rule.</p>
                <p id="p-44" data-page="46819">Further, assume that a company purchases a motor from a U.S. manufacturer, and that U.S. motor manufacturer purchases a magnet from a U.S. company. The U.S. magnet company purchases cobalt metal and samarium metal from China, and these metals are melted in the United States. This magnet would be compliant with both the restriction required by the specialty metals clause at DFARS 252.225-7009, Restriction on Acquisition of Specialty Metals, and the current restriction at 225.7018-2 and the clause at DFARS 252.225-7052, Restriction on the Acquisition of Certain Magnets, Tantalum, and Tungsten. However, this magnet would not be compliant with the requirements that will be effective on January 1, 2027.</p>
                <p id="p-45" data-page="46819">Further, assume that a company produces business jets and modifies them for military use. During a given year, the business jet manufacturer purchases 50 percent of its samarium-cobalt magnet needs from a U.S. source that mines and conducts all subsequent processing steps in the United States. The balance of the company's samarium-cobalt magnets is procured from Chinese sources and the company commingles domestically and Chinese-produced magnets on its production line. In this scenario, the modified business jet is compliant with the restriction at DFARS 225.7003-2 and the clause at DFARS 252.225-7009, Restriction on Acquisition of Specialty Metals, because it is a commercial derivative military article, and the company procures 50 percent of its total needs from a domestic source. However, the modified business jet is potentially noncompliant with the final rule, given the commingling of Chinese and U.S. samarium-cobalt magnets in each aircraft.</p>
                <p id="p-46" data-page="46819">Notwithstanding the significant change in scope, DoD notes that Congress enacted this requirement on January 1, 2021, through <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/116/public/283" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Public Law 116-283</a>. This five-year phase-in period, now revised to six years by section 854 of the NDAA for FY 2024, provides a reasonable period for industry to develop alternative sources of supply for covered materials from sources other than the People's Republic of China, the Russian Federation, the Democratic People's Republic of North Korea, and the Islamic Republic of Iran.</p>
                <p id="p-47" data-page="46819">DoD also notes that it has invested and continues to invest in domestic supply chains for covered materials, such as light and heavy rare earth elements and rare earth magnet manufacture, using authorities under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/50/4533" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">50 U.S.C. 4533</a> and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/4817" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 4817</a> among others. For those materials not currently covered by DoD investments, such as tantalum and tungsten, publicly-traded U.S. companies, including DoD contractors and their subcontractors, already are required to conduct supply chain due diligence on these minerals when they are necessary to the functionality or production of a product manufactured by that company. This requirement stems from section 1502 of <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/111/public/203" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Public Law 111-203</a> (enacted at <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-17/section-240.13p-1" class="cfr external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">17 CFR 240.13p-1</a>) to ensure that such minerals are not supporting armed conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries.</p>
                <p id="p-48" data-page="46819">The principal benefit of this rule is that it continues to transition the defense industrial base towards the procurement of strategic and critical materials from sources other than North Korea, Russia, Iran, or the People's Republic of China, with the latter constituting the pacing challenge identified in the National Defense Strategy. Notwithstanding the current and long-term challenge posed by China, Russia continues to pose an acute threat. Russia is a major producer and exporter of a wide array of strategic and critical materials, and the extreme volatility in these markets since Russia's invasion of Ukraine demonstrates the national security imperative to build resilience into supply chains for covered materials of this rule.</p>

                <p id="p-49" data-page="46819">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility.

                    <em>i.e.,</em>
                     North Korea, the People's Republic of China, Russia, or Iran) to include mined, refined, separated, melted, or produced. In addition, section 844 revises the commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) items exception to the restriction of 50 percent or more by weight to now include all covered material and remove the individual exception to only tungsten. The term &ldquo;covered materials,&rdquo; already defined in the statute and at DFARS 225.7018-1, means samarium-cobalt magnets, neodymium-iron-boron magnets, tantalum metals and alloys, tungsten metal powder, and tungsten heavy alloy or any finished or semi-finished component containing tungsten heavy alloy. Section 854 of the NDAA for FY 2024 extends the effective date of the revised requirements by one year.
