                <h1 id="h-6">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</h1>
                <h2 id="h-7">I. Background</h2>
                <p id="p-6" data-page="16003">DoD is amending the DFARS to implement section 1216 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/114/public/328" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 114-328</a>). Section 1216 requires that funding amounts available to the Department of Defense may not be obligated or expended for a construction or other infrastructure program or project of the Department in Afghanistan if military or civilian personnel of the United States Government, or their representatives with authority to conduct oversight of such program or project, cannot safely access such program or project. The prohibition may be waived with an approved determination.</p>
                <h2 id="h-8">II. Discussion and Analysis</h2>
                <p id="p-7" data-page="16003">To implement section 1216, this rule adds a new DFARS section 225.7705, Prohibition on use of funds for contracts of certain programs and projects in Afghanistan that cannot be safely accessed. The procedures provided in this new section are strictly internal to the Government, in that they instruct the contracting officer to not obligate funds on the covered contracts, unless (1) Government personnel can safely access the project, or (2) a determination is approved by the appropriate authority to waive this restriction, as outlined in the statute.</p>
                <h2 id="h-9">III. Applicability to Contracts at or Below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold and for Commercial Items, Including Commercially Available Off-the-Shelf Items</h2>
                <p id="p-8" data-page="16003">This rule does not add any new burdens or impact applicability of clauses and provisions at or below the simplified acquisition threshold, or to acquisition of commercial items.</p>
                <h2 id="h-10">IV. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563</h2>
                <p id="p-9" data-page="16003">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993. This rule is not a major rule under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/804" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 804</a>.</p>
                <h2 id="h-11">V. <a href="/executive-order/13771" class="eo">Executive Order 13771</a>
</h2>
                <p id="p-10" data-page="16003">This rule is not subject to <a href="/executive-order/13771" class="eo">E.O. 13771</a>, Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs, because the rule relates to agency organization, management, or personnel.</p>
                <h2 id="h-12">VI. Publication of This Final Rule for Public Comment Is Not Required by Statute</h2>
                <p id="p-11" data-page="16003">The statute that applies to the publication of the Federal Acquisition Regulation is codified at Title 41 of the United States Code (formerly known as the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act). Specifically, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1707" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C 1707(a)(1)</a> requires that a procurement policy, regulation, procedure or form (including an amendment or modification thereof) must be published for public comment if it relates to the expenditure of appropriated funds, and has either a significant effect beyond the internal operating procedures of the agency issuing the policy, regulation, procedure or form, or has a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors. This final rule is not required to be published for public comment, because it only provides procedures for United States Government personnel to follow for certain programs and projects in Afghanistan that cannot be safely accessed. These requirements affect only the internal operating procedures of the Government.</p>
                <h2 id="h-13">VII. Regulatory Flexibility Act</h2>
                <p id="p-12" data-page="16003">
                    Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment are not required to be given for this rule under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1707" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1707(a)(1)</a> (see section VI. of this preamble), the analytical requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a> 
                    <em>et seq.</em>) are not applicable. Accordingly, no regulatory flexibility analysis is required and none has been prepared.
                </p>
                <h2 id="h-14">VIII. Paperwork Reduction Act</h2>
                <p id="p-13" data-page="16003">The rule does not contain any information collection requirements that require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/44/3501" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44 U.S.C. chapter 35</a>).</p>
