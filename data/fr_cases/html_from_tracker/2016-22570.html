                <p id="p-7" data-page="65565">
                    DoD published a proposed rule in the 
                    <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                     at <a href="/citation/81-FR-28812" class="fr-reference" data-reference="81 FR 28812">81 FR 28812</a> on May 10, 2016, to implement section 813(a) of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/114/public/92" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 114-92</a>). Section 813(a) modifies <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2321" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2321(f)</a> to address rights in technical data relating to major weapon systems.
                </p>
                <p id="p-8" data-page="65565">Until now, except for commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) items, a contracting officer's challenge to asserted restrictions on technical data relating to a major system was sustained unless the contractor or subcontractor submitted information demonstrating that the item was developed exclusively at private expense.</p>
                <p id="p-9" data-page="65565">Section 813(a) revised <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2321" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2321(f)</a> in two primary ways: (1) The major systems rule was narrowed to apply only to major weapon systems; and (2) the exception to the major systems rule for commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) items was expanded to include three additional exceptions. More specifically, the formerly COTS-only exception was expanded to include (i) COTS items with modifications of a type customarily available in the commercial marketplace or minor modifications made to meet Federal Government requirements; (ii) commercial subsystems or components of a major weapon system, if the major weapon system was acquired as a commercial item in accordance with <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2379" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2379(a)</a>; and (iii) components of a subsystem, if the subsystem was acquired as a commercial item in accordance with <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2379" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2379(b)</a>.</p>
                <p id="p-10" data-page="65565">There were no public comments submitted in response to the proposed rule. There are no significant changes from the proposed rule made in the final rule.</p>
                <p id="p-11" data-page="65565">Although there were no comments received on the substance of the proposed rule, DoD did receive a request to suspend the rulemaking process on any case (including this case) relating to rights in technical data until such time as the final report of the Government-Industry Advisory Panel (the Panel), established in accordance with section 813(b) of the NDAA for FY 2016, has been submitted to Congress. After consultation with the Chair of the Panel, DoD determined to proceed with publication of the final rule on this case. This case implements section 813(a) of the NDAA for FY 2016, the same section that set up the Panel, with no indication that DoD should delay implementation. Furthermore, the law is very prescriptive and the proposed rule is a nearly verbatim implementation of the statutory language, so there could be no substantive change to this rule without a corresponding statutory change to <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2321" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2321</a>. The statute was effective upon implementation, and is expected to be beneficial to industry, including small businesses.</p>

                <p id="p-12" data-page="65565">In order to implement the statutory changes for validation of asserted restrictions on technical data, and apply the revised requirements and procedures to validation of asserted restrictions on computer software, this final rule amends&mdash;</p>

                <p id="p-18" data-page="65565">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993. This rule is not a major rule under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/804" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 804</a>.</p>
                <h2 id="h-11">V. Regulatory Flexibility Act</h2>
                <p id="p-19" data-page="65565">
                    A final regulatory flexibility analysis (FRFA) has been prepared consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>,

                    This rule was initiated to implement section 813(a) of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/114/public/92" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub.

                </p>
                <p id="p-21" data-page="65566">There were no public comments in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis.</p>
                <p id="p-22" data-page="65566">DoD cannot accurately determine the number of small entities that will be affected by this change in the regulations, because DoD does not have sufficient information about subcontract awards of subsystems and components of major weapon systems. However, DoD estimates an annual reduction of 50 prechallenge requests for information and 2 challenges of asserted technical data restrictions. DoD further estimates, based on data from the DoD FY 2014 Small Business Procurement Scorecard, that this reduction in challenges will affect about 17 small businesses (52 &times; 0.33).</p>
                <p id="p-23" data-page="65566">The final rule reduces the requirement to respond to Government challenge of restricted rights. Under current regulations, the presumption regarding development exclusively at private expense does not apply to major systems or subsystems or components thereof, except for commercially available off-the-shelf items. This rule expands applicability of the presumption regarding development exclusively at private expense with regard to a major weapon system, or a subsystem or component thereof, to cover&mdash;</p>
