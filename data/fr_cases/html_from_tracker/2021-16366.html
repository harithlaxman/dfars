                    <h2 id="h-7">I. Background</h2>
                    <p id="p-6" data-page="44249">DoD, GSA, and NASA published a proposed rule on June 3, 2020, at <a href="/citation/85-FR-34155" class="fr-reference" data-reference="85 FR 34155">85 FR 34155</a>, to implement section 1821 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 (section 1821(c) of <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/114/public/328" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 114-328</a>; <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/15/637" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15 U.S.C. 637 note</a>). Section 1821 requires the Small Business Administration (SBA) to amend its regulations to provide examples of activities that would be considered a failure to make a good faith effort to comply with a small business subcontracting plan. SBA issued a final rule at <a href="/citation/84-FR-65647" class="fr-reference" data-reference="84 FR 65647">84 FR 65647</a>, dated November 29, 2019, to implement section 1821 of the NDAA for FY 2017. In its final rule, SBA amended <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-13/section-125.3#p-125.3(d)(3)" class="cfr external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">13 CFR 125.3(d)(3)</a> to provide guidance on evaluating whether the prime contractor made a good faith effort to comply with its small business subcontracting plan and a list of examples of activities reflective of a failure to make a good faith effort.</p>
                    <p id="p-7" data-page="44249">Additionally, SBA revised <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-13/section-125.3#p-125.3(c)(1)(iv)" class="cfr external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">13 CFR 125.3(c)(1)(iv)</a> to require that prime contractors with commercial subcontracting plans include indirect costs in their subcontracting goals. Other than small business concerns that have a commercial subcontracting plan report on performance through a summary subcontract report (SSR). Prior to the publication of its final rule, SBA's regulations required that contractors using a commercial subcontracting plan must include all indirect costs in their SSRs, but did not require these contractors to include indirect costs in their subcontracting goals, which led to inconsistencies when comparing the data reported in the SSR to the goals in the commercial subcontracting plan.</p>
                    <p id="p-8" data-page="44249">Small business subcontracting plans are required from large prime contractors when a contract is expected to exceed $750,000 ($1.5 million for construction) and has subcontracting possibilities. FAR 19.704 lists the elements of the plan, which include the contractor's goals for subcontracting to small business concerns and a description of the efforts the contractor will make to ensure that small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns have an equitable opportunity to compete for subcontracts. Failure to make a good faith effort to comply with the plan may result in the assessment of liquidated damages per FAR 52.219-16, Liquidated Damages&mdash;Subcontracting Plan.</p>
                    <p id="p-9" data-page="44249">This final FAR rule requires that all indirect costs, with certain exceptions, are included in commercial plans and SSRs.</p>
                    <p id="p-10" data-page="44249">FAR 19.705-7 contains examples of a good faith effort, and examples of a failure to make a good faith effort.</p>
                    <p id="p-11" data-page="44249">Four respondents submitted public comments in response to the proposed rule.</p>
                    <h2 id="h-8">II. Discussion and Analysis</h2>
                    <p id="p-12" data-page="44249">The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council (the Councils) reviewed the public comments in the development of the final rule. A discussion of the comments received and any changes made to the rule as a result of the public comments are provided as follows:</p>

                    <p id="p-14" data-page="44249">
                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent commented that the rule should clarify that the &ldquo;good faith&rdquo; requirement is not applicable to subcontracts for commercial and COTS items under prime contracts. The respondent commented that the proposed rule does not address FAR 52.219-9(j), which states that subcontracting plans are not required from subcontractors when the prime contract contains the clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders&mdash;Commercial Items, or when the subcontractor provides a commercial item subject to the clause at 52.244-6, Subcontracts for Commercial Items, under a prime contract.

                        <em>Response:</em>
                         This rule does not revise the conditions for when a subcontracting plan is required. If a subcontracting plan is not required, then the examples of activities that would be considered a failure to make a good faith effort to comply with a small business subcontracting plan are not applicable. No changes were made to the final rule as a result of this comment.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent stated that the proposed FAR language at 19.705-7(d) is much broader than the SBA final rule and is unclear on whether &ldquo;material breach&rdquo; refers to the subcontracting plan or a breach of the contract itself.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-17" data-page="44249">
                        <em>Response:</em>
                         FAR 19.705-5(a)(5) requires that the subcontracting plan become a &ldquo;material part of the contract upon award.&rdquo; The final rule text at FAR 19.705-7(d), similar to the SBA final rule, cites FAR 52.219-16, Liquidated Damages&mdash;Subcontracting Plan, which provides the corrective actions available to all Federal Government contracting officers when a contractor fails to make a good faith effort to comply with the subcontracting plan, while also giving consideration to other Federal contracting regulations. In this context, a failure to make a good faith effort to comply with a subcontracting plan is a material breach, sufficient for the assessment of liquidated damages, and also for other remedies the Government may have. No changes were made to the final rule as a result of this comment.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent requested the proposed FAR language at 19.705-7(d) include language to indicate that the contractor has an opportunity to rebut and appeal before a determination of noncompliance is rendered and provided recommended text.

                         The clause at FAR 52.219-16, Liquidated Damages&mdash;Subcontracting Plan, which is cited in proposed FAR text 19.705-7(d), specifically 52.219-16(c), allows the contractor an opportunity to demonstrate what good faith efforts have been made and to discuss the matter, before the contracting officer's final decision. No changes were made to the final rule as a result of this comment.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent recommended that to remain consistent, the proposed language at FAR 19.705-7(b)(2) should either include the language contained in 52.219-16 or include references to the intent of 52.219-16, as the examples provided at FAR 19.705-7(b)(2) may occur without willful or intentional behavior. The respondent also recommended that intent and examples should be read together providing that an occurrence of the examples without intent would not constitute a violation. Specifically, failure to make a good faith effort must meet the &ldquo;willful or intentional&rdquo; standard. The respondent also provided various reasons why the FAR should make it clear that an occurrence of the examples without intent would not constitute a violation.

                        <em>Response:</em>
                         This final rule is implementing current SBA regulation. SBA's language at <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-13/section-125.3#p-125.3(d)(3)" class="cfr external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">13 CFR 125.3(d)(3)</a> provides guidance on evaluating whether the prime contractor made a good faith effort to comply with its small business subcontracting plan. This language parallels the language in SBA's rule providing contracting officers with examples to consider, in the context of the contractor's total effort, as possible indicators of a failure to make a good faith effort. SBA's rule does not reference the &ldquo;willful and intentional&rdquo; language. The FAR text will not be revised to incorporate the requested language as the &ldquo;willful and intentional&rdquo; language already appears in the definition of &ldquo;failure to make a good faith effort to comply with the subcontracting plan&rdquo; at both FAR 19.701 and in the clause at FAR 52.219-16. No changes were made to the final rule as a result of this comment.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent stated FAR 19.705-7(b)(2)(vi), as written, could be misinterpreted to hold a lower-tier contractor to the terms of a prime contractor's contract with the Government and recommended a revision to provide the intent of the text is to ensure a contractor pays its small business subcontractors in accordance with the terms of their contract with the small business.

                        <em>Response:</em>
                         The current text states, &ldquo;Failure to pay small business subcontractors in accordance with the terms of the contract with the prime contractor;&rdquo; and provides that the intent pertains to the subcontractor's contract with the prime contractor. The final rule FAR text will not be revised to include the recommended text.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent stated that the language at FAR 19.705-7(b)(2)(vii) should be revised to expressly require prime contractors to attend training as a remedy to any performance review findings. The respondent further stated that this is necessary given that a failure to attend the training offered by the Government could be perceived as a failure to make a good faith effort. The respondent provided recommended revisions to 19.705-7(b)(2)(vii).
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-25" data-page="44250">
                        <em>Response:</em>
                         The respondent's interpretation of the language at FAR 19.705-7(b)(2)(vii) is correct. If a contractor does not either correct substantiated findings or participate in subcontracting plan management training offered by the Government, it could be perceived by the contracting officer as a failure to make a good faith effort. This is not all inclusive of failure to make a good faith effort, but is one of many instances and examples used to show a lack of good faith effort on behalf of the prime contractor. Additionally, the contracting officer has the choice of requiring or recommending other corrective remedies as deemed necessary. The respondent's recommended language is more restrictive by suggesting &ldquo;and&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;or&rdquo; as written in the SBA rule. The final rule FAR text will not be revised to include the recommended text.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent stated that the preamble to the proposed rule indicates that the FAR Council is considering expanding the scope of the rule to include contracts at or below the simplified acquisition threshold (SAT) and recommended that the final FAR rule under this case should specify that it does not apply to contracts at or below the SAT. The respondent further stated that contracts at or below the SAT must be exempt from any policy or regulatory requirements pertaining to Small Business Plans.

                         One respondent stated that the language at FAR 19.705-7(b)(1)(v) does not make clear how a contracting officer would make a determination that a contractor has &ldquo;negotiated in good faith with interested small business.&rdquo; The respondent also states that it is not clear how a contractor would negotiate with a small business that is merely interested in participating as a subcontractor.

                         The language at FAR 19.705-7(b)(1)(v) is broadly written, as the intent is not to restrict or limit the contracting officer's authority or ability to determine the prime contractor's effort to negotiate in good faith.

                         One respondent had no issue with the proposed changes and clarifications in the language (FAR text) and agreed that the requirements should be consistent. However, the respondent disagreed with commercial subcontracting plans allowing large businesses to &ldquo;capture and be credited for small dollars spent&rdquo; that have nothing to do with the specific awarded Federal contract. The respondent recommended a maximum cap proposed at 0.5 percent to the large business and that any remaining credit or subcontracting expenditure allowed be with the small business directly involved and subcontracted to the

                        specific awarded Federal contract. The respondent further reiterated the original intent of the subcontracting law was to encourage large business primes to work and subcontract with small businesses in support of the Federal contract awarded and not to receive credit for unrelated work. Another respondent acknowledged the importance of prime contractors making a good faith effort to comply with SBA's small business subcontracting plan. The respondent further stated that the country is in the midst of a deadly pandemic and offered additional political commentary irrelevant to the subject FAR case.

                         The comments are outside the scope of this rule. The intent of this rule is to provide guidance on evaluating whether a prime contractor made a good faith effort to comply with its small business subcontracting plan and to provide a list of examples of activities reflective of a failure to make a good faith effort. Additionally, this rule is amending the FAR to require that all indirect costs, minus certain exceptions, are included in both commercial plans and summary subcontract reports.

                        comply with their subcontracting plans. Encouraging large prime contractors to meet their subcontracting goals may have a positive economic impact on any small business entity that wishes to participate in Federal procurement as a subcontractor.

                    <p id="p-45" data-page="44252">The final rule also requires prime contractors with commercial subcontracting plans to include indirect costs, with certain exceptions, in their subcontracting goals.

                    <p id="p-46" data-page="44252">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility.

The FRFA is summarized as follows:</p>
                    
                        <p id="p-49" data-page="44252">The objective of this final rule is to implement section 1821 of the NDAA for FY 2017 and SBA's implementing regulations, which provide examples of activities that would be considered a failure to make a good faith effort to comply with a small business subcontracting plan. SBA amended <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-13/section-125.3#p-125.3(d)(3)" class="cfr external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">13 CFR 125.3(d)(3)</a> to provide guidance on evaluating whether the prime contractor made a good faith effort to comply with its small business subcontracting plan and a list of examples of activities reflective of a failure to make a good faith effort.</p>
                        <p id="p-50" data-page="44252">Additionally, SBA amended <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-13/section-125.3#p-125.3(c)(1)(iv)" class="cfr external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">13 CFR 125.3(c)(1)(iv)</a> to require that large prime contractors with commercial subcontracting plans include indirect costs in the commercial subcontracting plan goals. Large prime contractors that have a commercial subcontracting plan report on performance through a Summary Subcontract Report (SSR) in the Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS). The FAR currently requires&mdash;as SBA's regulations required prior to publication of SBA's final rule&mdash;that a contractor using a commercial subcontracting plan include all indirect costs in its SSR. However, these regulations did not require contractors to include indirect costs in their commercial subcontracting plan goals, which leads to inconsistencies when comparing the data reported in the SSR to the goals in the commercial subcontracting plan.</p>
                        <p id="p-51" data-page="44252">There were no significant issues raised by the public comments in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis.</p>
                        <p id="p-52" data-page="44252">This rule may have a positive economic impact on any small entity that wishes to participate in Federal procurement as a subcontractor.</p>
                        <p id="p-53" data-page="44252">DoD, GSA, and NASA do not expect this rule to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule provides guidance to the contracting officer on evaluating whether the prime contractor made a good faith effort to comply with its small business subcontracting plan and a list of examples of activities reflective of a failure to make a good faith effort.</p>
                        <p id="p-54" data-page="44252">By providing examples of a failure to make a good faith effort to comply with small business subcontracting plans, the FAR will enable contracting officers to determine more easily whether large prime contractors have made a good faith effort to comply with their subcontracting plans and to hold large prime contractors accountable for failing to make a good faith effort to comply with their subcontracting plans. More diligence in developing and meeting subcontracting goals on the part of large prime contractors could have a positive impact of giving small business concerns more opportunities to subcontract on Federal contracts.</p>
                        <p id="p-55" data-page="44252">Data from the Federal Procurement Data System for fiscal years 2018 through 2020 indicate that there were 7,656 entities with 30,414 new awards that required subcontracting plans. Of the 30,414 new awards, 18 percent or 5,399 required commercial subcontracting plans. Additionally, 31 percent or 2,318 of the 7,656 unique awardees required commercial subcontracting plans. According to the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act Subaward Reporting System (FSRS), there are 19,596 unique entities who are subcontractors. Approximately 80 percent of the entities registered in the System for Award Management are small entities. Therefore, we estimate that 80 percent (15,677) of the subcontractors in FSRS are small entities. These small entities may benefit from this rule.</p>
                        <p id="p-56" data-page="44252">This final rule requires a large prime contractor with a commercial subcontracting plan to include indirect costs in its subcontracting goals. The benefit of requiring that indirect costs be included in subcontracting goals in commercial subcontracting plans is that it will increase the small business subcontracting goal and thus, increase the amount of funds the prime contractor will subcontract to small business concerns, providing more opportunities for subcontract awards to small business concerns.</p>
                        <p id="p-57" data-page="44252">This final rule does not include any new reporting, recordkeeping, or other compliance requirements for small entities.</p>

The subcontracting goals established for a commercial plan shall include all indirect costs with the exception of those such as the following: Employee salaries and benefits; payments for petty cash; depreciation; interest; income taxes; property taxes; lease payments; bank fees; fines, claims, and dues; original equipment manufacturer relationships during warranty periods (negotiated up front with the product); utilities and other services purchased from a municipality or an entity solely authorized by the municipality to provide those services in a particular geographical region; and philanthropic contributions. Once a contractor's commercial plan has been approved, the Government shall not require another subcontracting plan from the same contractor while the plan remains in effect, as long as the product or service being provided by the contractor continues to meet the definition of a commercial item.

                                 (1) In determining whether a contractor failed to make a good faith effort to comply with its subcontracting plan, a contracting officer must look to the totality of the contractor's actions, consistent with the information and assurances provided in its plan. The fact that the contractor failed to meet its subcontracting goals does not, in and of itself, constitute a failure to make a good faith effort (see 19.701). For example, notwithstanding a contractor's diligent effort to identify and solicit offers from any of the small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns, factors such as unavailability of anticipated sources or unreasonable prices may frustrate achievement of the contractor's subcontracting goals. The contracting officer may consider any of the following, though not all inclusive, to be indicators of a good faith effort:
                            </p>
                            <p id="p-73" data-page="44253">(i) Breaking out work to be subcontracted into economically feasible units, as appropriate, to facilitate small business participation.</p>

The notice shall give the contractor an opportunity to demonstrate what good faith efforts have been made before the contracting officer issues the final decision and shall further state that failure of the contractor to respond may be taken as an admission that no valid explanation exists.
