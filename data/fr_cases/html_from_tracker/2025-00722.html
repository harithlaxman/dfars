                <p id="p-6" data-page="5736">
                    DoD published a proposed rule in the 
                    <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                     at <a href="/citation/89-FR-31686" class="fr-reference" data-reference="89 FR 31686">89 FR 31686</a> on April 25, 2024, to implement section 815(b) of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2012 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/112/public/81" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 112-81</a>). Section 815(b) amended <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2321" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2321</a> (currently <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/3782" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 3782</a>) by increasing the validation period for asserted restrictions from three years to six years. Section 815(b) also amended <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2321" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2321</a> to provide an exception to the prescribed time limit for validation of asserted restrictions if the technical data involved are the subject of a fraudulently asserted use or release restriction. Two respondents submitted public comments in response to the proposed rule. DoD also held a public meeting on May 17, 2024.
                </p>
                <h2 id="h-8">II. Discussion and Analysis</h2>
                <p id="p-7" data-page="5736">DoD reviewed the public comments in the development of the final rule. A discussion of the comments and the changes made to the rule as a result of those comments is provided, as follows:</p>
                <h3 id="h-9">A. Summary of Significant Changes From the Proposed Rule</h3>
                <p id="p-8" data-page="5736">There are no significant changes from the proposed rule.</p>
                <h3 id="h-10">B. Analysis of Public Comments</h3>
                <h4 id="h-11">1. Technical Data or Software Delivered, Furnished, or Otherwise Provided to the Government</h4>
                <p id="p-9" data-page="5736">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     The respondents suggested that the revisions to the clauses at DFARS 252.227-7019, Validation of Asserted Restrictions&mdash;Computer Software, and 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data, to consistently reference technical data and computer software &ldquo;delivered or otherwise provided to the Government&rdquo; should be removed from the final rule. The existing clause language already references technical data delivered, software delivered, technical data required to be delivered, and software required to be delivered. Respondents assert that the phrase &ldquo;otherwise provided to the Government&rdquo; is ambiguous and inconsistent with existing statutes. The respondents also asserted that this language may result in a potential chilling effect on the relationship between Government and contractors.
                </p>
                <p id="p-10" data-page="5736">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     References to technical data and computer software &ldquo;delivered or otherwise provided&rdquo; to the Government appear multiple times in the current contract clauses at DFARS 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data&mdash;Other Than Commercial Products and Commercial Services, and DFARS 252.227-7014, Rights in Other Than Commercial Computer Software and Other Than Commercial Computer

      (<svg class="svg-icon svg-icon-doc-generic"><use xlink:href="/assets/fr-icons.svg#doc-generic"></use></svg> printed page 5737)

                    Software Documentation. These references cover technical data and computer software &ldquo;delivered or otherwise furnished&rdquo;, &ldquo;delivered or otherwise provided&rdquo;, and &ldquo;delivered, furnished, or otherwise provided&rdquo; to the Government, and both clauses reference the validation clauses. In addition, DFARS 252.227-7019(e) currently references &ldquo;software delivered, to be delivered under this contract, or otherwise provided to the Government in the performance of this contract.&rdquo; Accordingly, these revisions ensure consistency with existing language in DFARS 252.227-7019, 252.227-7013, and 252.227-7014, and clearly signals the scope of the validation clauses. The Government therefore declines the suggestion to remove these revisions from the final rule.
                </p>
                <h4 id="h-12">2. Changes To Align With Statutory Language Related to Restrictions Asserted</h4>
                <p id="p-11" data-page="5737">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     A respondent suggested that the replacement in several places in the DFARS of the phrase &ldquo;restrictive markings&rdquo; with the phrase &ldquo;asserted restriction&rdquo; is unnecessary for statutory alignment and may result in confusion.
                </p>
                <p id="p-12" data-page="5737">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The underlying statutes (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/3781" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 3781-3786</a>) repeatedly reference challenge, justification, and validation of &ldquo;restriction[s] asserted&rdquo; and &ldquo;asserted restriction[s].&rdquo; The statutes do not refer to restrictive markings. The final rule aligns the clauses with the underlying statutory language, and it creates consistent nomenclature and syntax throughout the clauses. The final rule references validation of &ldquo;asserted restrictions&rdquo;, rather than validation of restrictive markings (which is inconsistent with the statutory language and more likely to be confused with the separate procedures for ensuring conformity of those markings). Rather than the confusing syntax of &ldquo;striking&rdquo; an asserted restriction, the final rule references striking &ldquo;restrictive markings.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <h4 id="h-13">3. Definition of Fraud</h4>
                <p id="p-13" data-page="5737">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     The respondents requested clarification with respect to when a use or release restriction would be considered &ldquo;fraudulently asserted.&rdquo; In addition, the respondents proposed specific requirements and limitations for the Government when invoking this exception to the six-year challenge period.
                </p>
                <p id="p-14" data-page="5737">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     As stated in the proposed rule, the statutory revisions being implemented in DFARS Case 2022-D016 do not establish a specialized definition of &ldquo;fraudulently asserted&rdquo; or a knowledge requirement. The respondents proposed requirements and limitations on this exception to the six-year challenge period. The respondents did not provide, and DoD is not aware of, either an existing statute, policy, or regulation that includes the proposed requirements or limitations, or evidence of congressional intent to impose the proposed requirements or limitations.
                </p>
                <p id="p-15" data-page="5737">As with other instances of the term fraud in the Federal Acquisition Regulation and DFARS, DoD relies upon the common meaning of the terminology used in the statute and regulatory implementation, informed by applicable procurement statutes, other applicable statutes, and case precedent. In addition, the existing validation procedures require the Government to state the specific grounds for challenging the asserted restriction, which includes the grounds for invoking the exception to the six-year challenge period. Such grounds are subject to review by a court of competent jurisdiction or the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals.</p>
                <h4 id="h-14">4. Applicability to Commercial Products or Commercial Services</h4>
                <p id="p-16" data-page="5737">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     One respondent recommended revisions to the proposed language in DFARS 252.227-7037(e)(1) to clarify whether sufficient information to reasonably demonstrate funding for the development of commercial products or commercial services must be provided with every challenge.
                </p>
                <p id="p-17" data-page="5737">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The original language indicates that challenges will &ldquo;[s]tate the specific grounds for challenging the asserted restriction including, for commercial products or commercial services, sufficient information to reasonably demonstrate that the commercial product or commercial service was not developed exclusively at private expense.&rdquo; This requirement related to commercial products or commercial services is not optional, and the proposed revision was not intended to change this requirement. For the sake of clarity, the final rule reverts to the original language.
                </p>
                <h4 id="h-15">5. Question About Other Rulemaking Case</h4>
                <p id="p-18" data-page="5737">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     A respondent requested that DoD expedite the issuance of proposed rule for DFARS Case 2023-D022, Definition of Subcontract.
                </p>
                <p id="p-19" data-page="5737">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     This comment is outside the scope of this rule, which implements section 815(b) of the NDAA for FY 2012.
                </p>
                <h2 id="h-16">III. Applicability to Contracts at or Below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT), for Commercial Products (Including Commercially Available Off-the-Shelf (COTS) Items), and for Commercial Services</h2>
                <p id="p-20" data-page="5737">This final rule amends the clauses at DFARS 252.227-7019, Validation of Asserted Restrictions&mdash;Computer Software, and DFARS 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data. However, this final rule does not impose any new requirements on contracts at or below the SAT, for commercial products including COTS items, or for commercial services. The clause will continue to apply to acquisitions at or below the SAT, to acquisitions of commercial products including COTS items, and to acquisitions of commercial services.</p>
                <h2 id="h-17">IV. Expected Impact of the Rule</h2>
                <p id="p-21" data-page="5737">This final rule includes changes to lengthen the validation period for asserted restrictions from three years to six years. This final rule also provides an exception to the prescribed time limit for validation of asserted restrictions if the technical data or computer software involved are the subject of a fraudulently asserted restriction. Therefore, the final rule may increase the number of challenges to which contractors must respond. However, DoD cannot quantify the estimated number of the additional challenges at this time.</p>
                <h2 id="h-18">V. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563</h2>
                <p id="p-22" data-page="5737">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, as amended.</p>
                <h2 id="h-19">VI. Congressional Review Act</h2>

                    . The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has determined that this rule is not a major rule as defined by <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/804" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 804</a>.
                </p>

                <p id="p-24" data-page="5738">
                    A final regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>, 
                    <em>et seq.</em>
                     and is summarized as follows:
                </p>
                <p id="p-25" data-page="5738">DoD is amending the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) to implement section 815(b) of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2012 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/112/public/81" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 112-81</a>), which addresses the period for validation of proprietary data restrictions. The objective of the rule is to implement section 815(b), which amended <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2321" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2321</a> (currently <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/3782" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 3782</a>) by increasing the validation period for asserted restrictions from three years to six years. Section 815(b) also amended <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2321" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2321</a> to provide an exception to the prescribed time limit for validation of asserted restrictions if the technical data involved are the subject of a fraudulently asserted use or release restriction. This rule will ensure that the Government has adequate opportunity to challenge discrepancies or inaccuracies in contractor assertions of data and software rights.</p>
                <p id="p-26" data-page="5738">The public comments raised no significant issues in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis.</p>
                <p id="p-27" data-page="5738">This rule applies to small entities that have contracts with DoD requiring delivery of data, including technical data and computer software. DoD obtained data for fiscal years 2020 through 2022 from the Procurement Business Intelligence Service for all contracts and modifications that include one or more of the following DFARS clauses: 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data&mdash;Other Than Commercial Products or Commercial Services; 252.227-7014, Rights in Other Than Commercial Computer Software and Other Than Commercial Computer Software Documentation; 252.227-7015, Technical Data&mdash;Commercial Products and Commercial Services; and 252.227-7018, Rights in Other Than Commercial Technical Data and Computer Software&mdash;Small Business Innovation Research Program and Small Business Technology Transfer Program. DoD awarded on average 54,255 contract actions per year that included one or more of the listed clauses to 9,550 unique entities, of which 28,657 contract awards (53 percent) were made to 6,033 unique small entities (63 percent).</p>
                <p id="p-28" data-page="5738">This rule does not impose any new reporting, recordkeeping, or other compliance requirements for small entities.</p>
                <p id="p-29" data-page="5738">There are no known alternatives that would accomplish the stated objectives of the applicable statute.</p>

However, these changes to the DFARS do not impose additional information collection requirements to the paperwork burden previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under OMB Control Number 0704-0369, entitled DFARS Subpart 227.71, Rights in Technical Data; and Subpart 227.72, Rights in Computer Software and Computer Software Documentation, and related provisions and clauses.</p>

If, upon review of the explanation submitted, the Contracting Officer cannot determine the basis of the asserted restriction, the Contracting Officer may further request the Contractor or subcontractor to furnish additional information in the records of, or otherwise in the possession of or reasonably available to, the Contractor or subcontractor to justify the validity of any asserted restriction on technical data delivered, to be delivered, or otherwise provided to the Government under the contract or subcontract (

The Contracting Officer will issue this final decision within 60 days after receipt of the Contractor's or subcontractor's response to the challenge notice, or within such longer period that the Contracting Officer has notified the Contractor or subcontractor that the Government will require.

The Contractor or subcontractor agrees that, if it intends to file suit in the United States Court of Federal Claims, it will provide a notice of intent to file suit to the Contracting Officer within 90 days from the issuance of the Contracting Officer's final decision under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this clause. If the Contractor or subcontractor fails to appeal, file suit, or provide a notice of intent to file suit to the Contracting Officer within the 90-day period, the Government may cancel or ignore the restrictive markings that are based on the asserted restrictions, and the failure of the Contractor or subcontractor to take the required action constitutes agreement with such Government action.</p>

The Government will no longer be bound, and the Contractor or subcontractor agrees that the Government may strike or ignore the restrictive marking that is based on the asserted restriction, if the Contractor or subcontractor fails to file its suit within 1 year after issuance of the final decision. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the head of an agency determines, on a nondelegable basis, that urgent or compelling circumstances will not permit waiting for the filing of a suit in the United States Court of Federal Claims, the Contractor or subcontractor agrees that the agency may, following notice to the Contractor or subcontractor, authorize release or disclosure of the technical data. Such agency determination may be made at any time after issuance of the final decision and will not affect the Contractor's or subcontractor's right to damages against the United States where its asserted restrictions are ultimately upheld or to pursue other relief, if any, as may be provided by law.</p>
                            <p id="p-55" data-page="5739">(iv) The Government agrees that it will be bound by the asserted restrictions where an appeal or suit is filed pursuant to the Contract Disputes statute until final disposition by an agency Board of Contract Appeals or the United States Court of Federal Claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the head of an agency determines, on a nondelegable basis, following notice to the Contractor that urgent or compelling circumstances will not permit awaiting the decision by such Board of Contract Appeals or the United States Court of Federal Claims, the Contractor or subcontractor agrees that the agency may authorize release or disclosure of the technical data. Such agency determination may be made at any time after issuance of the final decision and will not affect the Contractor's or subcontractor's right to damages against the United States where its asserted restrictions are ultimately upheld or to pursue other relief, if any, as may be provided by law.</p>
