                         With regard to the use of a table to clarify the differing dollar thresholds associated with these terms, the preferred approach is to provide the guidance for processing a consolidated or bundled requirement in the area of the FAR where the respective subject matter is addressed. For example, the dollar threshold for triggering the Senior Procurement Executive's or Chief Acquisition Officer's determination of necessary and justified consolidation is discussed in the area of the FAR, 7.107-2, which addresses consolidation. Similarly, the dollar thresholds for substantial bundling and the attendant requirements for processing these acquisitions are provided at FAR 7.107-4. The FAR is arranged in this manner to allow contracting officers to quickly turn to the area of the FAR where the requisite guidance needed for their given situation is provided.

                    <p id="p-25" data-page="67764">
                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         Three respondents commented that the rule appeared to incorrectly or unnecessarily use the terms consolidation and bundling synonymously, by applying the same requirements to both. The respondents identified the following areas in the rule where they believed that this occurred:
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-26" data-page="67764">
                        &#9675; 
                        <em>FAR 7.103(u)(2).</em>
                         This paragraph currently urges acquisition planners to avoid unnecessary and unjustified bundling that precludes participation of small business as prime contractors. The rule proposes that planners also avoid unnecessary and unjustified consolidation. One respondent believes that a consolidation that precludes participation of small business as the prime would automatically be bundling and as such, the rule is proposing an unnecessary change.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-27" data-page="67764">
                        &#9675; 
                        <em>FAR 7.104(d).</em>
                         This paragraph currently requires coordination with the small business specialist when an acquisition meets the dollar thresholds for substantial bundling, unless the acquisition is set aside for small business. The small business specialist is required to notify the agency's small business office (
                        <em>e.g.,</em>
                         Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization) when the acquisition involves unjustified or unnecessary bundling or is not identified as bundling. The rule proposes to also require notification when the acquisition involves unjustified or unnecessary consolidation or is not identified as consolidation. It was pointed out that the coordination exemption for set-asides conflicts with the proposed notification requirement in cases where consolidation results in a small business set-aside because the small business specialist would not be coordinated with in such cases so they would not be able to provide the notification.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-28" data-page="67764">
                        &#9675; 
                        <em>FAR 7.105(b)(1)(iv).</em>
                         The rule proposes to require that for consolidated contract requirements, the acquisition plan identify the incumbent contractors and contracts affected by the consolidation. The FAR currently only requires this for bundled contract requirements. One respondent stated the proposed additional burden could result in listing thousands of contracts for a strategic sourcing acquisition and that there is no statutory requirement for said identification.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-29" data-page="67764">

                        <em>FAR 7.107-1.</em>
                         This subsection provides guidance on how consolidation and bundling could be determined necessary and justified. One respondent asked why the same requirements have to be met for both consolidation and bundling.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-30" data-page="67764">

                         One respondent asked why there is a requirement for coordination with the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) and/or a negative impact analysis on small businesses for consolidation if the consolidation results in a small business set-aside. The respondent believes that if the acquisition is not set aside then it would automatically be bundling and that bundling has the same justification process as consolidation.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-31" data-page="67764">

                         One respondent pointed out that this subsection starts out talking about bundling then in paragraph (c) mixes in consolidated requirements, which the respondent believes is mixing two completely different situations that are not synonymous.

                         The rule proposes to require that there be evaluation factors related to a small business subcontracting plan for consolidated requirements. Currently, the FAR only requires this for bundling. Two respondents pointed out that if a consolidated requirement is set aside for small business, a small business subcontracting plan would not be required.
                    </p>

                         One respondent asked why the rule is proposing to apply the requirement for 30-day notification to incumbent small businesses for consolidated requirements. The respondent also stated that paragraph (e)(2)(v) is confusing because the requirements of that paragraph would not apply if consolidation results in a small business set-aside.

                    <p id="p-37" data-page="67764">The final rule has also been revised at FAR 15.304(c) to clarify that consolidated requirements which are set aside for small business will not be required to use the small business subcontracting-related evaluation factors.

Because FAR 15.305(a)(5) requires that small business offerors get the highest rating for these factors, every offeror would receive the same rating for such factors in the scenario where a consolidated acquisition is set aside for small business, which would make use of such evaluation factors conflict with FAR 15.304(b)(2), which requires that evaluation factors support meaningful comparison and discrimination between and among competing proposals.</p>

                         One respondent asked whether the requirements for consolidation are necessary for acquisition of services from the Procurement List maintained by the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (also known as the AbilityOne Commission), which is considered a mandatory source in accordance with FAR 8.002.

                         For requirements that are on the Procurement List, the required source(s) to fulfill that work are already designated by the U.S. AbilityOne Commission. There would be no potential impact on small business participation or even on AbilityOne nonprofit agency participation if multiple Procurement List requirements are consolidated, because the sources will remain the same in accordance

                        with those listed on the Procurement List. For that reason, it would not be necessary to engage in the market research or analysis required in FAR 7.107-1 and 7.107-2 if the potential consolidation only involves required sources of supply and services such as requirements on the Procurement List.

                    <p id="p-41" data-page="67765">This same rationale applies to acquisitions from other mandatory sources. Therefore, the final rule has been revised at 7.107-1 to clarify that the consolidation and bundling requirements at 7.107 do not apply to acquisitions for which there are mandatory sources pursuant to FAR 8.002, &ldquo;Priorities for use of mandatory Government sources,&rdquo; or FAR 8.003, &ldquo;Use of other mandatory sources.&rdquo; The purpose of section 1313 of the Small Business Jobs Act was to limit the use of contract consolidation because of the anticipated negative impact of such an acquisition strategy on small business. However, requirements for which there is a mandatory source are not available to small business and as such, consolidation would result in no impact to small business, negative or positive. Further, neither <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/8504" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 8504</a> (the statutory authority behind the AbilityOne Program) nor <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/18/4124" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">18 U.S.C. 4124(a)</a> (another mandatory source&mdash;Federal Prison Industries) requires consolidation analyses for acquisitions done under their programs. Since application of the consolidation requirements would only create burden for the acquisition process and no benefit to small business, the Councils have determined, as a way of harmonizing different statutes, to exempt those consolidated contracts that can be met through one of the mandatory sources identified in FAR 8.002 or 8.003.</p>

                         The requirements to coordinate with the small business specialist when a requirement meets the threshold for substantial bundling already exist in the current FAR at 7.104(d)(1). The thresholds currently listed in FAR 7.104(d)(2)(i) still exist and are the thresholds used to differentiate &ldquo;bundling&rdquo; from &ldquo;substantial bundling&rdquo;. However, FAR 7.104 is being amended to remove the substantial bundling thresholds, which will be relocated in a new section, FAR 7.107-4 for clarity and consistency purposes.

                         Acquisition strategies are heavily considered in both the FAR and DFARS. As stated in the acquisition planning definition at FAR 2.101, acquisition planning includes developing the overall strategy for managing the acquisition. FAR 7.107-3(f)(2) in the final rule (formerly FAR 7.107(c)(2)) indicates that the acquisition strategy must provide for maximum practicable participation by small business concerns. FAR 7.107-4(b) in the final rule (formerly FAR 7.107(e)) goes further and describes additional elements for the acquisition strategy when there is substantial bundling.

                         The Councils reviewed the comment and have included in FAR 7.107-2(e) the similar authority contained in the final rule for FAR 7.107-3(f), which allows specific senior officials under certain circumstances to determine that consolidation is necessary and justified, even though expected benefits do not meet the quantifiable dollar thresholds for a substantial benefit.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent discussed the consolidation of contract requirements specified at FAR 7.107-2 and expressed that the $2 million dollar threshold which would require a justification is adequate, without being overly burdensome. Additionally, the respondent commented that the review process and the impact analysis on small businesses when contract consolidation is being contemplated are preventive measures to ensure consolidation is justified.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent recommended additional guidance to be provided to clarify the term &ldquo;measurably substantial&rdquo; when agencies are quantifying specific benefits to be achieved from bundling. FAR 7.107-3(b) requires an agency to quantify the specific benefits identified through market research and other techniques to explain how their impact would be measurably substantial (see 10.001(a)(2)(iv) and (a)(3)(vii)).

                    <p id="p-69" data-page="67767">The respondent is also concerned that after market analysis and cost analysis is complete, if the benefits do not meet the thresholds for a substantial benefit, the military service acquisition executive, Deputy Secretary, or equivalent position may still determine that bundling is necessary and justified. The respondent is concerned that this section could convert itself to a catch-all for any acquisition that does not meet the requirements but the Agency still feels compelled to bundle.</p>

The respondent further commented that the documentation requirements of specific benefits to be derived from substantial bundling are a positive protection for small businesses.

                         Two respondents commented on the requirements at FAR 7.107-5(a) to notify each small business performing a contract that it intends to bundle the requirement with one or more other requirements at least 30 days prior to the issuance of the solicitation for the bundled requirement. Both respondents considered that the 30 day time period was insufficient. One respondent stated that the Government must know this far in advance of 30 days. The other respondent noted that 30 days does not provide adequate time for the small business to coordinate with the designated SBA Procurement Center representative or designated contact. The respondent suggested at least 45 calendar days.

The respondent had concerns that this rule appeared to indicate that the normal requirement is to set up multiple-award contracts only for large business and overlooks the process for set-aside contracts. This respondent suggested that the provision should provide for a higher evaluation of a large business teaming with a small business, or if it has a substantial small business subcontracting plan.

                         The provision at FAR 52.207-6 is required by section 1312(a) of the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 and the SBA regulations.

There is no exception to joint venture size affiliation for offers received from Small Business Teaming Arrangements under the Department of Defense Pilot Mentor-Prot&eacute;g&eacute; Program. In addition, a clarification is added in paragraph (3) of the definition, that this exception to affiliation applies in the case of a solicitation of offers for a bundled contract with a reserve (as stated at <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-13/section-121.103#p-121.103(b)(9)" class="cfr external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">13 CFR 121.103(b)(9)</a>).

The definition of &ldquo;Consolidation&rdquo; has been amended to remove redundant terms. The phrase &ldquo;contract requirements&rdquo; is removed for clarity wherever it is associated with bundling and consolidation in the final rule, since bundling and consolidation apply to orders as well as contracts.</p>
                    <p id="p-92" data-page="67768">For consistency, the final rule amends the text at FAR 5.205(g) to reflect the specific text at FAR 7.107-5(b)(2), instead of paraphrasing.</p>

The use of this distinct terminology is due to FAR subpart 7.1 already having a definition for &ldquo;order&rdquo; which does not accurately describe the orders to which bundling and consolidation requirements apply. Consequently, because there is no conflicting definition of &ldquo;order&rdquo; in FAR subparts 8.4 or 16.5, the final rule has been amended to remove the proposed use of the distinct terminology in those subparts.</p>
                    <p id="p-96" data-page="67768">The final rule contains a number of editorial changes such as the addition of cross-references in FAR 7.107-2, 7.107-3, and 7.107-6, removal of redundant text in 7.107-5(a), and the deletion of &ldquo;significant&rdquo; from 19.201(c)(5)(i) as there is no definition for &ldquo;significant bundling&rdquo;.</p>

                    <p id="p-97" data-page="67768">This rule creates provision FAR 52.207-6, Solicitation of Offers from Small Business Concerns and Small Business Teaming Arrangements or Joint Ventures (Multiple-Award Contracts), in order to implement paragraph (a) of section 1312 of the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010. This paragraph concerns <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/15/644" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15 U.S.C. 644</a>, Awards or Contracts, and therefore applies as a matter of law to COTS items. The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council, pursuant to the authority granted in <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1906" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1906</a>, List of laws inapplicable to procurements of commercial items, and the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy, pursuant to the authority granted in <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1907" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1907</a>, List of laws inapplicable to procurements of commercially available off-the-shelf items, have determined that it would not be in the best interest of the Federal Government to exempt solicitations for the acquisition of commercial items from the applicability of paragraph (a) of section 1312, entitled &ldquo;Leadership and Oversight,&rdquo; of the Small Business Jobs Act, or to exempt solicitations for the acquisition of commercial items or for COTS from the applicability of paragraph (a) of section 1313, entitled &ldquo;Consolidation of Contract Requirements&rdquo;. The FAR provision 52.207-6, Solicitation of Offers from Small Business Concerns and Small Business Teaming Arrangements or Joint Ventures (Multiple-Award Contracts), has been written so that the application of the provision is carefully tailored, consistent with the statute. The provision is a notice to offerors that imposes no burdens, but simply encourages small business concerns and small business teaming arrangements or joint ventures of small business concerns to submit offers on multiple-award contracts above the substantial bundling threshold of the Federal agency. Therefore, the potential benefits to small business entities outweigh any potential drawback of application to acquisitions of commercial items.</p>
                    <p id="p-98" data-page="67768">The consolidation requirements of section 1313 should apply to all contracts and subcontracts above the threshold(s) specified in the statute, including contracts and subcontracts for the acquisition of commercial items and COTS. The statute requires agencies to ensure increased consideration of small businesses in connection with the establishment of multiple award contracts and acquisitions that consolidate contracts. Not applying these requirements to the maximum extent possible would exclude a significant number of acquisitions which would not help to protect the interests of small businesses and boost their opportunities in the Federal marketplace. Not applying the consolidation requirements to the acquisition of commercial items or COTS would limit the full implementation of the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010. For all of these reasons, it is in the best interest of the Federal Government to apply the consolidation requirements to all contracts and subcontracts above the threshold(s) specified in the statute.</p>
