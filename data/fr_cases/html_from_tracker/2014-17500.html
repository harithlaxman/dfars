                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         The respondent commented that the revised regulation can be read and understood to allow an agency to declare all costs associated with responding to a whistleblower complaint of reprisal as presumptively unallowable until the matter is completely litigated and the contractor prevails, at which point the contractor's recovery of the reasonable net costs are limited by the not-to-exceed-80 percent rule. According to the respondent, this effectively forces the contractor to finance the defense of such claims, even if the cost of settlement could be less than the cost of defense.
                    </p>

                        <em>Response:</em>
                         This interim rule has directly implemented the statutory requirement. The costs incurred in connection with any proceeding brought by a contractor or subcontractor employee submitting a whistleblower complaint of reprisal in accordance with <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/4712" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 4712</a> or <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2409" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2409</a> are treated exactly the same as the pre-existing cost principle treats costs incurred in connection with any proceeding brought by a Federal, State, local, or foreign government for violation of, or a failure to comply with, law or regulation by the contractor (including its agents or employees), or costs incurred in connection with any proceeding brought by a third party in the name of the United States under the False Claims Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/31/3730" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">31 U.S.C. 3730</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-13" data-page="43589">Any proceedings costs which are incurred in connection with any proceeding under FAR 31.205-47(b), and which are not made unallowable by that paragraph, are subject to the allowability rules of FAR 31.205-47(c), (d), and (e). The not-to-exceed-80 percent rule in the provisions of FAR 31.205-47(e)(3), which addresses the allowability of reasonable net costs incurred in connection with proceedings described in paragraph (b), applies equally to all proceedings addressed in paragraph (b), including those proceedings for whistleblower complaints of reprisal added by <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/4712" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 4712</a> or <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2409" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2409</a>.</p>
                    <p id="p-14" data-page="43589">
                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         The respondent considered that the interim rule effectively prohibits settlement of whistleblower claims by making related legal costs entirely unallowable if the proceeding &ldquo;could have led&rdquo; to an agency order for corrective action, with no apparent exceptions.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-15" data-page="43589">The respondent noted the statement in the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis that this rule &ldquo;would only affect a contractor if a contractor employee commenced a proceeding by submitting a complaint under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2409" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2409</a>, and if that proceeding resulted in imposition of a monetary penalty or an order to take corrective action.&rdquo; The respondent did not reach a similar conclusion, because the rule also affects a contractor who settles a whistleblower case that &ldquo;could have led&rdquo; to imposition of a monetary penalty or an order to take corrective action. The respondent requested that language be added at FAR 31.205-47(c), to provide the same treatment for whistleblower complaints as is currently provided for settlement of any proceeding brought by a third party under the False Claims Act in which the United States did not intervene.</p>
                    <p id="p-16" data-page="43589">
                        <em>Response:</em>
                         The Councils have incorporated the requested change in the final rule. The FAR includes paragraph (c) to provide interpretation of the cost principle when the matter is resolved through consent or compromise. Now that whistleblower proceedings have been included in paragraph (b), it is reasonable that they should be covered in paragraph (c) as well.

                    <p id="p-17" data-page="43589">The Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has also been reworded to address potential impact if the proceedings result in the consequences covered by paragraphs 31.105-47(b)(3) through (b)(5).</p>

                        DoD, GSA, and NASA have prepared a Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (FRFA) consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>,

                    </p>
                    
                        <p id="p-20" data-page="43590">This action implements sections 827(g) and 828(d) of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2013. The objective of this rule is to address the allowability of legal costs incurred by a contractor in connection with a proceeding commenced by an employee submitting a complaint under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2409" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2409</a> or <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/4712" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 4712</a>. The statutory authority is <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2324" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2324(k)</a> and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/4310" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 4310</a>.</p>
                        <p id="p-21" data-page="43590">There were no significant issues raised by the public comments in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis.</p>
                        <p id="p-22" data-page="43590">Most contracts awarded on a fixed-price competitive basis do not require application of the cost principles. Most contracts valued at or below the simplified acquisition threshold are awarded on a fixed price competitive basis. Requiring submission of certified cost or pricing data for acquisitions that do not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold is prohibited (FAR 15.403-4(a)(2)). According to Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) data for FY 2012, there were 73,014 Federal new contract awards over the simplified acquisition threshold in FY 2012. Of those contracts, only 11,279 awards were to small businesses on other than a competitive fixed-price basis. Within that number of awards, this rule would only affect a contractor if a contractor employee commenced a proceeding by submitting a complaint under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2409" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2409</a> or <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/4712" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 4712</a>, and if that proceeding resulted in any of the consequences listed at FAR 31.205-47(b). DoD, GSA, and NASA do not have data on the percentage of contracts that involve submission of a whistleblower complaint and result in monetary penalty or an order to take corrective action. There are no reporting, recordkeeping, or other compliance requirements in this rule.</p>
