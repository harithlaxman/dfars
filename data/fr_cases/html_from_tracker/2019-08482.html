                <p id="p-18" data-page="18154">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     The respondent recommended a change to the proposed rule text in DFARS 204.804(3)(i)(C) to replace &ldquo;individual&rdquo; with &ldquo;contracting official&rdquo; to ensure the required determination would be made by a contracting official.
                </p>
                <p id="p-19" data-page="18154">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     To ensure the contracting officer retains the requisite authority to execute expedited closeouts, the proposed DFARS 204.804(3)(i)(C) text will be revised to: &ldquo;Has been determined by a contracting official, approved at least one level above the contracting officer, to be not otherwise reconcilable. . . .&rdquo;

                <p id="p-20" data-page="18154">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     The respondent recommended revisions to DFARS 204.804(3)(i)(C)(
                    <em>2</em>) to establish a measure to define &ldquo;disproportionate&rdquo; and to revise the text to reflect a &ldquo;general rule&rdquo; of 20 percent to determine &ldquo;disproportionately excessive&rdquo;.
                </p>
                <p id="p-21" data-page="18154">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The text at DFARS 204.804(3)(i)(C)(
                    <em>2</em>) includes the term &ldquo;disproportionate&rdquo; to establish that DoD's estimate of time and effort are determined to be greater than the amount owed to a level of imbalance. DoD has concerns that the use of a general measure may become an implied rule. It is not the intent of the DoD to identify a threshold, but to leave the determination of disproportion to the contracting officer's discretion.

                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     The respondent recommended adding a provision to create a template and implement a reporting requirement.

                <p id="p-23" data-page="18154">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     Creation of a solicitation provision is not necessary to implement the requirement for the Secretary of Defense to notify the Congressional defense committees within 10 days of exercising the authority at section 836(d) to waive any provision of acquisition law or regulation in order to closeout contracts under the section 836 authority. Rather, a new paragraph (3)(iv) is added at DFARS 204.804 regarding the authority, which has been delegated to USD(A&amp;S), to waive any provision of acquisition law or regulation to close out contracts as authorized by section 836 and implemented at DFARS 204.804(3)(i). A reference to internal operating procedures at DFARS Procedures, Guidance, and Information 204.804(3)(iv) is also provided, which direct departments and agencies to forward requests to waive provisions of acquisition law or regulation to the Principal Director, Defense Pricing and Contracting, who will forward the request to USD(A&amp;S), as appropriate.

                <p id="p-24" data-page="18154">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     The respondent had concerns over the waiver authority for acquisition laws or regulations necessary for closeout of contracts under section 836(a).
                </p>
                <p id="p-25" data-page="18154">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     Waiver of acquisition laws and regulations necessary to close contracts must be, under statute, within the parameters of the congressionally granted authority. In accordance with section 836(d)(1) of the NDAA for FY 2017, the USD(A&amp;S) is authorized to waive any provision of law or regulation in order to carry out the closeout procedures as authorized in section 836(a)-(c).

                <h4 id="h-15">5. DoD 7000.14-R, Financial Management Regulation Update</h4>

                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     The respondent recommended updates to the DoD 7000.14-R, Financial Management Regulation.
                </p>
                <p id="p-27" data-page="18154">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     This rule is implementing in the DFARS sections 836 of the NDAA for FY 2017, as modified by section 824 of the NDAA for FY 2018, to permit close out of certain contracts or groups of contracts. Updating the DoD 7000.14-R is beyond the scope of this rule.

                <h4 id="h-16">6. Restate FAR 4.804-5(b) Requirements for Contract Closeout Actions in DFARS</h4>
                <p id="p-28" data-page="18154">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     The respondent recommended restating required contract closeout actions specified in FAR 4.804-5(b) in DFARS 204.804.
                </p>
                <p id="p-29" data-page="18154">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The FAR requirements at 4.804-5(b) are applicable to DoD, as stated in the FAR. Restating the FAR text in the DFARS would be duplicative and is unnecessary.
