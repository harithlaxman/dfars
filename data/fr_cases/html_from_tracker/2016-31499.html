                         One respondent stressed that contractors should not be penalized until guilt is determined by a court of law. Contractors should be reimbursed for their costs, as incurred, at the time of their participation in a Congressional investigation or inquiry. While affirming that it only makes sense that a contractor found guilty of defrauding or cheating the Government in association with their work should forfeit their reimbursement, the respondent maintained that, until guilt is determined by a court of law, the contractor should be reimbursed for its costs. Then, if the contractor is found guilty of defrauding or cheating the Government, it should pay those costs back to the Government.

The regulation clearly states that costs are unallowable if incurred in connection with a Congressional investigation or inquiry into an issue that is the subject matter of a proceeding that results in a specified disposition. Absent a specified disposition, no disallowance of costs would exist.

The respondent noted that, in many cases, small businesses incur hundreds of thousands of dollars in costs associated with the inquiry, despite the fact that the only thing they did wrong was work for a Government entity that was targeted by a political party.

                         One respondent questioned whether FAR 31.205-47(c) or (d) would impact the allowability of the cost of a Congressional investigation or inquiry. Specifically, the respondent asked if the cost of a Congressional investigation or inquiry related to an issue that is the subject matter of a FAR 31.205-47(b) proceeding, whose result is described in FAR 31.205-47(b)(1) through (5), would be unallowable if one of the circumstances described in FAR 31.205-47(c) or (d) existed.

                        <em>Response:</em>
                         The cost of a Congressional investigation or inquiry cannot be treated the same as the cost of a proceeding under FAR 31.205-47(c) or (d). Although the section 857 language ties the cost of the Congressional investigation or inquiry to an issue that is the subject matter of a proceeding resulting in a disposition as described in <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2324" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2324(k)(2)</a>, Congress did not enact parallel treatment. <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2324" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2324(e)(1)(O)</a> disallows &ldquo;Costs incurred by a contractor in connection with any criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding commenced by the United States or a State, to the extent provided in subsection (k),&rdquo; which includes the exceptions in paragraphs (k)(3) and (k)(4), covered in the FAR at 31.205-47(c) and (d). Section 857, as implemented in <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2324" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2324(e)(1)(Q)</a>, references only paragraph (k)(2) and does not reference paragraph (k) in its entirety; nor does it reference paragraphs (k)(3) or (k)(4) specifically.

                         one described in FAR 31.205-47(b)(1) through (5), would be subject to the limitations in FAR 31.205-47(e).

Because there is no overlap between the two concepts, there is no need to clarify that relationship in the FAR text.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent questioned whether the FAR 31.205-47(g) segregation of cost requirements are to be imposed regarding costs that may be made unallowable based on FAR 31.603(b)(15) or (16). Since the proposed rule does not address this issue, there was a question as to whether FAR 31.205-47(g) is applicable to costs that may be made unallowable based on FAR 31.603(b)(15) or (16). For costs that may be made unallowable under FAR 31.205-47, the respondent argued that it would be in the Government's best interest for: (1) State, local, and federally recognized Indian tribal governments to segregate and account separately for costs that may be made unallowable under FAR 31.603(b)(15) and FAR 31.603(b)(16) during the pendency of a related proceeding, and (2) the contracting officer to normally withhold payment of such costs. Accordingly, the respondent recommended that FAR 31.603(b)(15) and (16) be revised to incorporate requirements similar to those in FAR 31.205-47(g).

                         The Councils appreciate this concern, but note that adding this as a requirement would require a separate FAR case. Although segregation of potentially unallowable costs (as described at FAR 31.205-47(g)) is a prudent business practice for State, local, and federally recognized Indian tribal governments, section 857 of the NDAA for FY 2016 did not extend this requirement to such entities.

                    <h4 id="h-15">5. Clarification of Regulatory Intent of FAR 31.205-47(f)(9)</h4>
                    <p id="p-28" data-page="4733">
                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent focused a question upon Congressional inquiry or investigation activities that predate the existence of the proceeding, noting that the proposed version of FAR 31.205-47(f)(9) makes unallowable costs incurred in connection with a Congressional investigation or inquiry into an issue that is the subject matter of a proceeding resulting in a disposition as described in FAR 31.205-47(b)(1) through (5). The respondent interpreted this to mean that, in order for the costs of the Congressional investigation or inquiry to be unallowable, a proceeding would have to be in process. Therefore, it would follow that costs incurred in connection with a Congressional investigation or inquiry that predate the existence of a proceeding are allowable. Specifically, even if the issue becomes the subject matter of a FAR 31.205-47 proceeding at a later date, there is no intention under the proposed rule to retroactively make costs incurred in connection with a Congressional investigation or inquiry that is the subject matter of the proceeding unallowable. If that understanding is incorrect and the rule's intent is to make the costs incurred in connection with a Congressional investigation or inquiry that pre-date the existence of a proceeding unallowable, then the proposed rule should be revised to state that requirement in the cost principle.

                         The same respondent asked about Government Accountability Office (GAO) investigations, noting that the proposed version of FAR 31.205-47(f)(9) makes unallowable the costs incurred in connection with a Congressional investigation or inquiry into an issue that is the subject matter of a proceeding resulting in a disposition described in FAR paragraphs 31.205-47(b)(1) through (5). The respondent stated that no specifics are provided in the proposed rule concerning what is considered a Congressional investigation or inquiry into an issue that is the subject matter of a proceeding, cautioning that this could lead to different interpretations concerning costs incurred to facilitate or respond to a GAO audit or request, in the event that the project was suggested or specifically required by a Congressional committee or subcommittee. The respondent posited that some might conclude that the proposed rule makes such costs unallowable, and requested confirmation that there is, in fact, no intent to make such costs unallowable.

                         The Councils believe that Congress intended <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2324" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2324(e)(1)(Q)</a> to apply only to investigations and inquiries conducted by Congress, 
                        <em>per se.</em>
                         Therefore, under FAR 31.205-47(f)(9), the potential disallowance and requisite segregation of costs would not be triggered by the GAO's efforts, but rather by an actual investigation or inquiry conducted by Congress. Further, the language is clear in its applicability to a Congressional investigation or inquiry into an issue&mdash;one that is the subject matter of a proceeding, a known event.

                    <p id="p-32" data-page="4733">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This has been deemed a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993. This rule is not a major rule under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/804" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 804</a>.</p>
                    <h2 id="h-17">IV. Regulatory Flexibility Act</h2>
                    <p id="p-33" data-page="4733">
                        DoD, GSA, and NASA have prepared a Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (FRFA) consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>, 
                        <em>et seq.</em>
                         The FRFA is summarized as follows:
                    </p>
                    
                        <p id="p-34" data-page="4733">
                            DoD, GSA, and NASA do not expect this rule to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 
                            <span class="printed-page-inline unprinted-element document-markup" data-page="4734">

                            <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>, 
                            <em>et seq.,</em>
                             because the rule will be manifested as a cost principle to which only select small businesses are subject. Pursuant to FAR 31.000, the cost principles are applicable to contracts, subcontracts, and modifications whenever cost analysis is performed, or when a contract clause requires the determination or negotiation of costs. An analysis of contracts awarded during Fiscal Year 2014, the most recent full year for which information was available, revealed that fewer than 200 small businesses were performing contracts subject to FAR 31.
                        </p>
                        <p id="p-35" data-page="4734">
                            Again, the rule merely disallows costs incurred in the extremely rare instances when a contractor incurs costs in connection with a Congressional investigation or inquiry into an issue resulting in a disposition (
                            <em>e.g.,</em>
                             conviction, liability, corrective action, etc.), as described in <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2324" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2324(k)(2)</a>. Accordingly, given the miniscule segment of the small business population that could potentially be impacted by the rule, and the low likelihood of the conditions being met, the impact on small businesses is insignificant.
                        </p>
                    
                    <p id="p-36" data-page="4734">There were no significant issues raised by the public in response to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis provided in the proposed rule. The final rule applies to all entities, both small and other than small, performing as contractors or subcontractors on U.S. Government contracts, and who are required to abide by the Cost Principles at FAR part 31. However, the rule is not expected to have a significant impact.</p>
                    <p id="p-37" data-page="4734">There are no reporting, recordkeeping, or other information collection requirements of the rule.</p>
                    <p id="p-38" data-page="4734">DoD, GSA, and NASA did not identify any significant alternatives that would reduce the impact on small entities and still meet the objectives of the statute.</p>
