                    <p id="p-6" data-page="64680">A summary for the FAR rule follows. For the actual revisions and/or amendments made by this FAR case, refer to the specific subject set forth in the document following this item summary. FAC 2020-02 amends the FAR as follows:</p>
                    <h2 id="h-7">Reporting of Nonconforming Items to the Government-Industry Data Exchange Program (FAR Case 2013-002)</h2>
                    <p id="p-7" data-page="64680">This final rule amends the FAR to require contractors and subcontractors to report to the Government-Industry Data Exchange Program (GIDEP) certain counterfeit or suspect counterfeit parts and certain major or critical nonconformances. This change implements sections 818(c)(4) and (c)(5) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, which require DoD contractors and subcontractors to report counterfeit or suspect counterfeit electronic parts purchased by or for DoD to GIDEP. In addition, the FAR Council extended coverage of the proposed rule by policy to cover other Government agencies, other types of parts, and other types of nonconformance. In response to public comments, this final rule has more limited scope than the proposed rule, exempting contracts and subcontracts for commercial items and limiting the clause application to acquisitions of items that require higher level quality standards, critical items, or electronic parts by or for DoD.</p>
