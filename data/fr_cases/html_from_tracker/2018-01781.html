                    DoD published a proposed rule in the 
                    <strong>Federal Register</strong>

L. 114-92</a>, enacted November 25, 2015), as well as the requirements of section 831 of the NDAA for FY 2013 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/112/public/239" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub.

This rule provides guidance to contracting officers for making price reasonableness determinations, promotes consistency in making commercial item determinations, and expands opportunities for nontraditional defense contractors to do business with DoD.

                <p id="p-8" data-page="4431">On August 3, 2015, DoD published proposed DFARS rule 2013-D034 to implement the requirements of section 831 of the NDAA for FY 2013 (<a href="/citation/80-FR-45918" class="fr-reference" data-reference="80 FR 45918">80 FR 45918</a>).

                <p id="p-10" data-page="4432">Twelve respondents submitted public comments in response to the proposed rule. DoD reviewed the public comments in the development of this final rule. A discussion of the comments and the changes made to the rule as a result of those comments are provided as follows:</p>
                <h3 id="h-9">A. Summary of Significant Changes</h3>
                <p id="p-11" data-page="4432">1. For consistency in terminology, the word &ldquo;data&rdquo; has been changed to &ldquo;information&rdquo; where appropriate throughout the rule.</p>
                <p id="p-12" data-page="4432">2. The language at DFARS 212.102(a)(ii) has been revised to state that a contracting officer may presume that a prior commercial item determination, or a determination that overturned a prior commercial item determination, made by a military department, a defense agency, or another component of DoD shall serve as a determination for subsequent procurements of such item.</p>
                <p id="p-13" data-page="4432">3. The language at DFARS 212.102(a)(iii) on nontraditional defense contractors was reworded for clarity.</p>
                <p id="p-14" data-page="4432">4. The language at DFARS 212.209(b) and 215.404-1(b)(ii) was amended to add the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; to allow contracting officers to consider recent purchase prices paid by both the Government &ldquo;and&rdquo; commercial customers for the same or similar commercial items.</p>
                <p id="p-15" data-page="4432">5. DFARS 215.404-1(b)(iv) and 234.7002(d)(3), have been revised such that if the contracting officer determines that the pricing information submitted is not sufficient to determine the reasonableness of price, the contracting officer shall request other relevant information to include cost data. The proposed rule directed that the contracting officer may request other relevant information to include cost data.</p>
                <p id="p-16" data-page="4432">6. To expedite commercial item determinations, the provision at DFARS 252.215-7010, paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) has been revised to require offerors to provide contract numbers and if available, a Government point of contact for items that have been previously determined to be commercial.</p>
                <p id="p-17" data-page="4432">7. The provision at DFARS 252.215-7010, paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B) has been reworded to remove the unintended offeror certification language from the proposed rule.</p>
                <p id="p-18" data-page="4432">8. The provision at DFARS 252.215-7010, paragraph (d) has been reworded to require &ldquo;the minimum information necessary&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;all data&rdquo; to permit a determination that the proposed price is fair and reasonable.</p>
                <p id="p-19" data-page="4432">9. The proposed rule language at DFARS 252.215-7010, paragraph (d)(3) has been removed as unnecessary, and paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5) have been renumbered accordingly.</p>
                <p id="p-20" data-page="4432">10. The language at DFARS 252.215-7010, paragraph (d)(3), formerly paragraph (d)(4), has been reworded for clarity.</p>
                <p id="p-21" data-page="4432">11. The DFARS provision 252.215-7013, Supplies and Services Provided by Nontraditional Defense Contractors, has been added to advise offerors that in accordance with <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2380a" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2380a</a>, supplies and services provided by a nontraditional defense contractor, as defined in DFARS 212.001, may be treated as commercial items.</p>

                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     One respondent recommended that DFARS 252.215-7010(b)(2) mirror the entire language of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-20(a)(2) because the respondent did not believe that Congress intended for either section 831 of the NDAA for FY 2013 or sections 851 and 853 of the NDAA for FY 2016 to expand the Government's access to cost or profit information when commercial items are priced based on catalog or market prices, or set by law or regulation.

                <p id="p-27" data-page="4432">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     Section 831 of the NDAA for FY 2013 requires the establishment of standards for determining the extent of uncertified cost information that should be required in cases in which price information is not adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of price. To that extent, the rule sets forth a hierarchy of information that the contracting officer shall require to determine the reasonableness of the price, including other relevant information that can serve as the basis for a price assessment. Further, section 853 requires that contracting officers shall consider evidence provided by offerors of recent purchase prices paid by the Government for the same or similar commercial items in establishing price reasonableness on a subsequent purchase if the contracting officer is satisfied that the prices previously paid remain a valid reference for comparison after considering the totality of other relevant factors such as the time elapsed since the prior purchase and any differences in the quantities purchased or applicable terms and conditions.

                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     Two respondents recommended removing or revising the catalog pricing provision. The respondents recommended deleting DFARS 252.215-7010(b)(1)(ii)(B)(
                    <em>2</em>) because it is not based on any provision in the NDAA for FY 2013 or the NDAA for FY 2016, and is unclear about what it means for &ldquo;catalog pricing&rdquo; to be &ldquo;consistent&rdquo; or &ldquo;not consistent&rdquo; with &ldquo;all relevant sales data.&rdquo; According to the respondent, the provision raises these unanswered questions:
                </p>
                <p id="p-30" data-page="4432">(a) Does &ldquo;catalog pricing&rdquo; refer to prices shown in the catalog in question or in the offeror's proposed pricing for the proposal?</p>
                <p id="p-31" data-page="4432">(b) Does &ldquo;catalog pricing&rdquo; refer to prices shown in the catalog that must be used in the pricing of all sales in order for that pricing to be &ldquo;consistent&rdquo; with &ldquo;all relevant sales data?&rdquo;</p>
                <p id="p-32" data-page="4432">(c) Does the determination of consistency take into account whether &ldquo;catalog pricing&rdquo; is higher or lower than the pricing reflected in &ldquo;all relevant sales data&rdquo;?</p>
                <p id="p-33" data-page="4432">(d) How does the use of the term &ldquo;all relevant sales data&rdquo; in the provision relate to the definition of the term &ldquo;relevant sales data&rdquo; in the proposed DFARS provision 252.215-7010(a)?</p>
                <p id="p-34" data-page="4432">The respondent is concerned that contracting officers will not know what offerors mean by these statements, which could lead to confusion and misunderstandings.</p>
                <p id="p-35" data-page="4432">Another respondent recommends removing the requirement in DFARS 252.215-7010 that an offeror provide an explanation as to whether their proposed prices that are based on catalog pricing are consistent with relevant sales data.

                    <em>Response:</em>

                    <em>2</em>) has been revised to remove the certification requirements. However, for a commercial item exception, the offeror shall submit, at a minimum, information that is adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the price for the acquisition, including prices at which the same item or similar items have been sold in the commercial market.

The catalog must state prices at which sales are currently, or were last made to a significant number of buyers constituting the general public. If the catalog pricing provided is not consistent with all relevant sales data, the offeror must describe the differences. It does not matter whether the catalog price is higher or lower than the proposed price. &ldquo;Relevant sales data&rdquo; means evidence provided by an offeror of sales of the same or similar items that can be used to establish price reasonableness taking into consideration the age, volume, and nature of the transactions (including any related discounts, refunds, rebates, offsets or other adjustments).

                     DoD concurs with the statement that an open exchange of information by both parties leads to more timely commercial item determinations and price analysis. DoD has already issued guidance to contracting officers to collaborate with the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) cadre of experts to assist in the timeliness and consistency of commercial procurements. The cadre regularly engages with offerors to obtain an understanding of proposed commercial items and associated pricing. DCMA is also facilitating collaboration with offerors through commercial item memorandums of agreement with interested companies.

                <p id="p-41" data-page="4433">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     One respondent questioned if there is no commercial market place to establish price reasonableness and the contractor only offers an item that is &ldquo;of a type&rdquo; customarily used by the general public for sale, is that sufficient for the contractor to escape the Truthful Cost or Pricing Data requirement? The respondent further questioned what constitutes an offer, and whether an advertisement on a website is sufficient? The respondent suggested that the rule define an &ldquo;offer&rdquo; to incorporate a bona fide offer in a known market where competitive forces exist.
                </p>
                <p id="p-42" data-page="4433">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     DoD considers commercial item determinations separately from price reasonableness determinations. Commercial item determinations are not dependent upon the offered price of an item. The FAR 2.101 definition of &ldquo;commercial item&rdquo; does not require that the identical proposed item must be sold or offered for sale to the general public. When deciding whether to grant a commercial item exception to the requirement for certified cost or pricing data, FAR 2.101 permits contracting officers to consider items that are &ldquo;of a type&rdquo;&mdash;
                    <em>i.e.,</em>
                     items that are similar to those customarily used by and sold or offered for sale to the general public. While pricing based on market prices is the preferred method to establish a fair and reasonable price, a commercial marketplace is not required for the item to meet the definition of a commercial item. This embraces DoD's broader view of the types of items that may qualify as commercial items and gives consideration to products and services offered by both traditional and nontraditional defense contractors. Contracting officers must use business judgement and consider all relevant factors when evaluating evidence of offers for sale, which may include advertisements on websites, sales orders, quotes, or other information that demonstrate that the similar item has been offered for sale in the commercial marketplace.

                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     One respondent stated that the final rule should permit commercial item determinations in a timely and efficient manner with minimal deliberations. The respondent further suggested that any further guidance that might be issued in support of commercial item determinations after the final rule is published would greatly improve its chances of succeeding and facilitate the desired results of the final rule.

                    <em>Response:</em>
                     Timely and consistent commercial item determinations are the standard for DoD. The proposed rule promotes timeliness and efficiency by providing that contracting officers may presume that a prior commercial item determination made by a military department, defense agency, or another component of DoD shall serve as a determination for subsequent procurements. As such, DoD has instructed contracting officers to adopt the practice of recognizing prior known determinations as valid. To further assist in the timeliness and consistency of commercial procurements, DoD has established a cadre of experts within DCMA to provide advice to contracting officers. DCMA is also streamlining the exchange of information for the evaluation and pricing of commercial items through &ldquo;memorandums of agreement&rdquo; with interested companies. DoD will finalize the Commercial Item Handbook to provide further guidance to contracting officers.

                     Two respondents recommended that commercial item determinations for exceptions from certified cost or pricing data be separated from price reasonableness determinations. One respondent recommended that DFARS 252.215-70XX(b)(1)(ii) be amended by striking the phrase &ldquo;For a commercial item exception&rdquo; and replacing it with the phrase &ldquo;For items determined to be commercial&rdquo; to ensure that the commercial item determination and the price reasonableness determination are kept separate.

                <p id="p-49" data-page="4433">(b) It forces them to concurrently meet both the commercial item determination and price reasonableness data submission criteria, which will invite contracting officers to use the submitted cost or pricing data to actually determine initial commerciality, rather than using one or more of the current FAR 2.101 definitions of commercial items.</p>

                    is necessary for an exception to submitting certified cost or pricing data. Pricing information is not solely determinative of whether a product or service is a &ldquo;commercial item,&rdquo; yet that is the only information the proposed language requires. DoD should make improvements to FAR 52.215-20 with supplemental guidance, which not only implements the requirements of section 831 of the NDAA for FY 2013 and sections 851, 852, and 855 of the NDAA for FY 2016, but also clarifies important distinctions that are critical to DoD's commercial item acquisition. This distinction was maintained by Congress, for a commercial item determination to be made and only then for price reasonableness to be assessed. The respondent asserted that commercial items determinations should be focused on the Government's market research and the commercial item definition in FAR 2.101, and cost or pricing data required for price reasonableness determinations should be uncertified when required by the clause to support the Government's price reasonableness determination.

                     DoD considers commercial item determinations separately from price reasonableness determinations, however, offerors are still expected to provide adequate supporting data with their proposal submissions in order to avoid unnecessary delays in contract award. It would not be in the best interest of DoD or industry to delay acquisitions by establishing a formal two-step sequential proposal process of first requiring supporting information only for the purpose of making a commercial item determination, and then following up with a second request for information in order to make a determination of price reasonableness. In accordance with DFARS 252.215-7010, and consistent with the existing requirements of FAR 52.215-20, where commercial items are proposed in response to a solicitation, the offeror is required to concurrently submit information that is adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the proposed price.

The Congressman addressed his concern with DoD's attempts to restrict &ldquo;offered for sale&rdquo; and &ldquo;of a type&rdquo; commercial item procurements, and its negative impact on the innovative defense community and the Government's defense mission. A contracting officer's commerciality determination may have long-ranging effects that impact the company's interest in investing private capital into innovation or participating in the Government marketplace. These are most likely to be dual-use and second-tier suppliers that tend to be among our most innovative and that are willing to invest their own money in development.

The Senate and the House have included provisions in the NDAA for FY 2016 to entice new firms into the defense market and retain them once there. The Senator stated that the rule would deter privately-held start-up companies from offering their products and services to DoD, because it would impose cumbersome and excessive bureaucratic requirements on these firms and require firms to build entirely new accounting systems.

Included in this hierarchy is a review of information on prices paid.

One respondent recommended deleting the requirement at DFARS 252.215-7010(b)(1)(ii)(D) that an offeror must provide proof of a commercial item exception when an item is sold via an active FSS contract, because it is redundant and unsupported by statue.

Cir. 2015)). In addition, the proposed rule disregards the prior work of the General Services Administration FSS contracting officers, and provisions of the NDAA do not require proof that a commercial item exemption has been granted for a schedule item.

                     Section 851 of the NDAA for FY 2016 provided the authority for DoD contracting officers to presume that a prior commercial item determination made by a military department, a defense agency, or another component of the Department of Defense shall serve as a determination for subsequent procurements of such item. This does not preclude contracting officers from applying a commercial item exception when an item is sold via an active FSS contract. However, this statutory language does not mandate that DoD contracting officers apply the same presumptions to prior commercial item determinations made by non-DoD agencies. Therefore, the language at DFARS 252.215-7010(b)(1)(ii)(D) remains unchanged.

Since it's a fact that the &ldquo;of a type&rdquo; commercial item category is the most widely used designation by innovative subcontractors, then it is also a fact that the new DFARS requirement for &ldquo;concurrent&rdquo; productions of cost or pricing data with a commercial item determination application will impact that class of subcontracted items the most.

This same DFARS requirement first imposed in 2015, squarely conflicts with the older pragmatic DFARS policy requirement in DFARS 244.402 that mandates that only prime contractors &ldquo;shall determine whether a particular subcontract item meets the definition a commercial item.&rdquo; This will not alleviate the inevitable log jam of subcontract commercial item applications on major weapons.

                     One respondent expressed concern that the definition of &ldquo;market prices&rdquo; focuses on &ldquo;current prices.&rdquo; The proposed definition could be interpreted by contracting officers to limit market prices to only those prices that have just been agreed to by a customer, and in extreme cases, only prices that are less than a few days old. Whether a price is &ldquo;current enough&rdquo; to be relevant varies based on many factors that are best addressed through guidance on age of data rather than within the definition of market prices. The respondent pointed out that section 853 of the NDAA for FY 2016 uses the term &ldquo;recent&rdquo; in lieu of the term &ldquo;current.&rdquo; The difference between &ldquo;recent&rdquo; and &ldquo;current&rdquo; is significant. &ldquo;Recent&rdquo; is having happened not long ago whereas &ldquo;current&rdquo; means in the present, contemporaneous, or being used or done now.

                     Recent prices paid can be used in the determination of price reasonableness. &ldquo;Market prices&rdquo; means current prices that are established in the course of ordinary trade between buyers and sellers free to bargain, and that can be substantiated through competition or from sources independent of the offerors. At any point in time, the market price would be the current price.

                     One respondent stated that for an item to be exempt from submitting certified cost or pricing data, a commercial market place should exist that allows for establishing price reasonableness. Excluding this requirement from the definition of a commercial item has created a policy for which proposed regulations have tried and failed to work around.

                     This rule does not revise the established FAR definition of a commercial item which, in part, specifically identifies an item that &ldquo;Has been offered for sale, lease, or license to the general public&rdquo;. Section 831 of the NDAA for FY 2013 requires that standards be established for determining the extent of uncertified cost information that should be required in cases in which price information is not adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of price. While pricing based on market prices is the preferred method to establish a fair and reasonable price, a commercial marketplace is not required for the item to meet the definition of a commercial item. Furthermore, the rule sets forth a hierarchy of information that the contracting officer shall require to determine the reasonableness of the price, including other relevant information that can serve as the basis for a price assessment.

                     DoD agrees that understanding the market place, even if there is limited research, is critical for commercial item determinations. DoD disagrees that &ldquo;where appropriate&rdquo; indicates that it is conditional, but simply if it is appropriate at that point in the acquisition process. Market research also informs decisions at several other points in the requirements development and acquisition process, and is one of several techniques contracting officers may use to reach a conclusion regarding price reasonableness.

                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     One respondent stated that under FAR 15.403-1, if a minor modification of a commercial item exceeds the greater of the threshold for obtaining certified cost or pricing data or 5 percent of the total price of the contract, certified cost or pricing data are required. The respondent questioned whether equivalent requirements apply to price reasonableness assessments based on a &ldquo;similar&rdquo; item. The respondent believes that conceptually it seems it should. The respondent further questioned if there is a difference between a &ldquo;similar&rdquo; item and an item that has been modified, and whether a &ldquo;similar&rdquo; item can be an unmodified item of the item being purchased.
                </p>
                <p id="p-105" data-page="4436">Another respondent suggested that the rule define a &ldquo;similar&rdquo; item as an item that is so sufficiently comparable in technical and physical characteristics that the differences in price due to those differences is not material to the assessment of price reasonableness. The respondent further stated that if significant price differences are allowed for similar items, there seems no meaningful way to distinguish similar items from modified items.</p>
                <p id="p-106" data-page="4436">One respondent stated that in practice one of the biggest obstacles to determine price reasonableness on commercial items is the physical differences between the item being acquired and the item for which sales data is provided. It is difficult for the Government or contractor personnel to assess the price impact, with any level of fidelity, of the physical differences without associated price or cost data. Parametric models typically generate values with a gross level of precision, especially when using data from sources external to the manufacturer. The respondent suggested that the rule address data required for modifications of an item to include the technical or physical differences and the associated price or cost impact of each. The respondent further suggested that the rule address data required for &ldquo;similar&rdquo; items to include the technical or physical differences and the associated price or cost impact of each; including the data requirements for subcontractors in 252.215-7010, Requirements for Certified Cost or Pricing Data and Data Other Than Certified Cost or Pricing Data.

                    acquired, but may require data other than certified cost and pricing data as defined in FAR 2.101 to support a determination of a fair and reasonable price. The rule does not define &ldquo;similar items&rdquo; for the purposes of determining price reasonableness, but authorizes contracting officers, when appropriate, to require the contractor to supply information that is sufficient to determine the reasonableness of price, including information showing the similar item is comparable to the item being purchased to be used as a comparison in price reasonableness. Since no two contract actions are exactly the same, the rule provides a broad framework for data requirements. Contracting officers must use business judgement and consider all relevant factors including the similarity of items when making comparisons for the purposes of determining price reasonableness. Further information on the comparison of same or similar items may be found at FAR 15.404-1(b)(2)(ii).

                     One respondent recommended adding a DFARS provision that clearly separates commercial item determinations of &ldquo;end items/weapons&rdquo; by the contracting officer from commercial item determinations by prime contractors of subcontractor subsystems and components. This addition will streamline commercial item procurements.

                     Contracting officers must validate a previous commercial item determination and document the file appropriately. DoD agrees with the respondent that the identification of contract numbers is beneficial. In accordance with DFARS 252.215-7010, for items previously determined to be commercial, offerors are required to identify the contract and military department, defense agency, or another DoD component that rendered such determination. To expedite the commercial item determination, this language has been revised to include the contract number and, if available, a Government point of contact. Additionally, offerors are also required to provide information that is adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the price for the acquisition.

                     One respondent strongly believed the proposed rule goes much further than implementing section 831(a) of the NDAA for FY 2013 and sections 851-853, 855-857 of the NDAA for FY 2016. The respondent asserts that the requirement for submission of cost or price data concurrently with a contractor's commercial item determination request under DoD-funded prime contracts and commercial subcontracts would impose significant time and paperwork burdens on prime contractors for submission to the contracting officer. Although section IV. of this preamble indicates there will be no significant economic impact on a substantial number of entities, the converse is true. It is a major rule which will have a significant adverse effect on competition, investment and innovation, especially in the innovative subcontractor market place. In addition, the respondent states that commercial items merely &ldquo;offered for sale&rdquo; in the commercial market are implicitly excluded from ever getting a positive commercial item determination because they can't meet their DFARS clauses &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; prior sales data standard.

                    <em>Response:</em>
                     There is no minimum prior sales standard that impacts the determination of commerciality. If an offeror does not have sales data to submit, the rule provides a list of other data that may be submitted, such as prices paid for similar levels of work or effort on related products or services. As previously stated, offerors are expected to provide adequate supporting data with their proposal submissions. It would not be in the best interest of DoD or industry to delay acquisitions by establishing a formal two-step sequential proposal process of first requiring supporting information only for the purpose of making a commercial item determination, and then following up with a second request for information in order to make a determination of price reasonableness. The rule does not contain any new information collection requirements that require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/44/3501" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44 U.S.C. chapter 35</a>).

                     The rule does not preclude the contracting officer from considering any cost data. DFARS 215.404-1 provides that if the contracting officer determines that the pricing information submitted is not sufficient to determine the price reasonableness, the contracting officer may request other relevant information, to include cost data. The language does not create a prohibition, but does provide a hierarchy that includes incorporation as to when to request other relevant information. Additional references within the rule, to include DFARS 212.209(d), provide that nothing in the section shall be construed to preclude the contracting officer from requiring the contractor to supply information that is sufficient to determine the reasonableness of the price. This would further reinforce that there is not a prohibition in place to restrict obtaining other than certified cost or pricing data when necessary to determine price reasonableness.

                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     One respondent recommended revising the definition of &ldquo;Volume and completeness of transaction data&rdquo; to remove the requirement to identify the customer as part of the key information. Further, the respondent recommended adding the phrase &ldquo;to the extent it is reasonably available and can be released by the offeror.&rdquo; Many commercial customer sales agreements contain non-disclosure provisions that restrict the seller's ability to disclose contract information, including customer identity, outside of the organization. These confidentiality provisions are extremely common in business-to-business agreements due to the fact that the identity of a business's suppliers and the prices paid to those suppliers is competitively sensitive information. A supplier may determine that price information may be disclosed so long as the customer's identity is not included with the disclosure, however requiring that both the price and the customer be identified puts the supplier at risk of violating contractual agreements with other customers. Using the phrase &ldquo;released by the offeror&rdquo; will allow the current practice of allowing the contracting officer to view un-redacted invoices (but not physically collect them) to ensure the data provided to the Government supports price reasonableness.
                </p>
                <p id="p-198" data-page="4440">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The language states &ldquo;customer&rdquo; but does not state &ldquo;customer name.&rdquo; It is relevant to the contracting officer whether the customer is a commercial customer versus a Government customer. The subsequent paragraph provides further clarification that the DoD contracting officer needs to understand the type of customer.

                <p id="p-202" data-page="4441">The objective of this rule is to implement sections 851 through 853 and 855 through 857 of the NDAA for FY 2016 and section 831 of the NDAA for FY 2013. Sections 831, 851, and 853 address requirements related to commercial items. The statutes are silent on applicability to contracts for the acquisition of commercial items or commercially-available-off-the shelf (COTS) and do not provide for criminal or civil penalties. Therefore, sections 831, 851, and 853 do not apply to the acquisition of commercial items unless the Director, Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy (DPAP) makes a written determination as provided in <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1906" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1906</a> to apply the statutes for commercial items and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1907" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1907</a> for COTS items.

                <p id="p-203" data-page="4441">This final rule prescribes the use of a new DFARS provision 252.215-7010, to be used in lieu of FAR provision 52.215-20, Requirements for Certified Cost or Pricing Data and Data Other Than Certified Cost or Pricing Data. The new DFARS provision includes the existing requirement under FAR provision 52.215-20 for offerors to submit certified cost and pricing data and data other than certified cost or pricing data, as appropriate; however, the new DFARS provision adds levels of granularity to assist offerors in their proposal preparation with regards to &ldquo;other than certified cost or pricing data&rdquo; and implements a statutory exemption to the requirement for &ldquo;certified cost or pricing data&rdquo; for nontraditional defense contractors.</p>
                <p id="p-204" data-page="4441">This rule will impact large businesses and small entities who currently compete on DoD solicitations issued using FAR part 15, Negotiation Procedures, and are valued at $750,000 or more. Offerors competing on contracts and orders subject to the new DFARS provision, will have the benefit of additional details on (and a hierarchy of) the types of &ldquo;other than certified cost or pricing data&rdquo; that they should consider including in their proposal. This information has the potential to improve the quality of proposals from businesses and reduce resubmissions of data during negotiations. In addition, this rule adds a statutory exemption from the requirement to submit &ldquo;certified cost or pricing data&rdquo; for nontraditional defense contractors, who may now &ldquo;other than certified cost or pricing data,&rdquo; which takes less time to prepare.</p>
                <p id="p-205" data-page="4441">Finally, this rule also advises contracting officers that they may presume that a prior commercial item determination made another DoD component shall serve as a determination for subsequent procurements of such items, unless the contracting officer obtains a determination from the head of the contracting activity that the item is not commercial and the basis for that decision.</p>
                <p id="p-206" data-page="4441">DoD has performed a regulatory cost analysis on this rule. The following is a summary of the estimated public cost savings in millions, which are calculated in 2016 dollars at a 3-percent and 7-percent discount rate:</p>

                <p id="p-210" data-page="4441">A final regulatory flexibility analysis has been performed and is summarized as follows:</p>
                <p id="p-211" data-page="4441">This rule amends the DFARS to provide additional guidance to contracting officers on making price reasonableness determinations, expand opportunities for nontraditional defense contractors to do business with DoD, and provide additional details on the types of &ldquo;other than certified cost or pricing data&rdquo; that offerors should include in their proposal in order to for the purposes of determining whether proposed prices for commercial items are fair and reasonable. The objective of this rule is to implement the requirements of sections 851 through 853 and 855 through 857 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/114/public/92" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub.

L. 112-239</a>, enacted January 2, 2013) and section 848 of the NDAA for FY 2018 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/115/public/91" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 115-91</a>, enacted December 12, 1017).</p>
                <p id="p-212" data-page="4441">There were no significant issues raised by the public in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis.</p>
                <p id="p-213" data-page="4441">This rule will apply to contractors that compete for contracts being awarded using FAR part 15 Negotiation procedures that are valued at $750,000 or more. According to data available in the Federal Procurement Data System for FY 2016, DoD awarded approximately 6,865 contracts meeting this criteria to 5,105 unique contractors, of which 4,544 contracts (~66 percent) were to 3,536 (~70 percent) unique small businesses.</p>
                <p id="p-214" data-page="4441">
                    DoD does not expect this rule to have a significant impact on the small businesses that may be affected by this rule, because the rule does not add to or remove any of the existing requirements for the submission of other than certified cost or pricing data for the purpose of determining the reasonableness of prices proposed for commercial items. Rather the rule provides offerors additional details and a hierarchy of the &ldquo;other than certified cost or pricing data&rdquo; that should be included in their proposals. This additional detail could reduce the amount of time it takes a small business resubmit data during negotiations. In

                    addition, the exception to &ldquo;certified cost or pricing data&rdquo; for nontraditional defense contractors would be of benefit to small businesses that meet the definition.

This permissive authority is intended to enhance defense innovation and investment, enable DoD to acquire items that otherwise might not have been available, and create incentives for nontraditional defense contractors to do business with DoD. It is not intended to recategorize current noncommercial items, however, when appropriate, contracting officers may consider applying commercial item procedures to the procurement of supplies and services from business segments that meet the definition of &ldquo;nontraditional defense contractor&rdquo; even though they have been established under traditional defense contractors. The decision to apply commercial item procedures to the procurement of supplies and services from nontraditional defense contractors does not require a commercial item determination and does not mean the item is commercial.
