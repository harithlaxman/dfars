                    <p id="p-6" data-page="61017">DoD, GSA, and NASA published a proposed rule at <a href="/citation/85-FR-65610" class="fr-reference" data-reference="85 FR 65610">85 FR 65610</a> on October 15, 2020, to amend the FAR definition of &ldquo;commercial item&rdquo; to implement section 836 of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/115/public/232" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 115-232</a>). Section 836 separates the definition of &ldquo;commercial item&rdquo; at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/103" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 103</a> into the definitions of &ldquo;commercial product&rdquo; and &ldquo;commercial service,&rdquo; at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/103" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 103</a> and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/103a" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">103a</a>.</p>
                    <p id="p-7" data-page="61017">
                        Splitting the definition of &ldquo;commercial item&rdquo; into the definitions of &ldquo;commercial product&rdquo; and &ldquo;commercial service&rdquo; was a recommendation made by the independent panel created by section 809 of the NDAA for FY 2016 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/114/public/92" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 114-92</a>). The panel was created to review and improve the functioning of the defense acquisition system and eliminate any regulations found unnecessary to achieve such improvements. The panel recommended the splitting of the definition of &ldquo;commercial item&rdquo; to better &ldquo;reflect the significant roles services and commercial services play today in the DoD procurement budget.&rdquo; See recommendation on pages 29 to 30 of Volume 1 of 3 dated January 2018 of the Report of the Advisory Panel on Streamlining and Codifying Acquisition Regulations, available at 
                        <em><a href="https://section809panel.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Sec809Panel_Vol1-Report_Jan18_REVISED_2018-03-14.pdf" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://section809panel.org/&#8203;wp-content/&#8203;uploads/&#8203;2018/&#8203;04/&#8203;Sec809Panel_&#8203;Vol1-Report_&#8203;Jan18_&#8203;REVISED_&#8203;2018-03-14.pdf</a>.</em></p>
                    <p id="p-8" data-page="61017">The change in this final rule resolves the issue the Section 809 Panel cites, which is that the &ldquo;acquisition workforce has faced issues with inconsistent interpretations of policy, confusion over how to identify eligible commercial products and services&rdquo;. Bifurcating the definition of &ldquo;commercial item&rdquo; into &ldquo;commercial product&rdquo; and &ldquo;commercial service&rdquo; is a way to provide clarity for the acquisition workforce, which may result in greater engagement with the commercial marketplace.</p>
                    <p id="p-9" data-page="61017">It is important to note that the amendment to separate &ldquo;commercial item&rdquo; into &ldquo;commercial product&rdquo; and &ldquo;commercial service&rdquo; does not expand or shrink the universe of products or services the Government may procure using FAR part 12, nor does it change the terms and conditions with which contractors must comply.</p>
                    <p id="p-10" data-page="61017">The following summarizes the changes made to the FAR:</p>
                    <p id="p-11" data-page="61017">1. Removed from FAR part 2 the definition of &ldquo;commercial item&rdquo; and replaced it with the definitions of &ldquo;commercial product&rdquo; and &ldquo;commercial service&rdquo; in accordance with the NDAA with only minor revisions for clarification to align with that which is currently in the FAR. The clarification in paragraph 3(ii) of the definition of &ldquo;commercial product&rdquo; has been in FAR part 2 since the definition of &ldquo;commercial item&rdquo; was incorporated by FAR case 94-790, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in 1995. Paragraphs 2(i) and 2(ii) of the definition of &ldquo;commercial service&rdquo; are also long standing; they stem from a FAR change published October 22, 2001, which was revised slightly in a FAR change published June 18, 2004.</p>
                    <p id="p-12" data-page="61017">2. Replaced all instances of &ldquo;non-commercial&rdquo; and &ldquo;noncommercial&rdquo; with &ldquo;other than commercial&rdquo; as it relates to this rule. This editorial change provides consistent language throughout the FAR.</p>
                    <p id="p-13" data-page="61017">3. Removed FAR 12.102(g), and a corresponding reference at FAR 37.601(c), as obsolete. FAR 12.102(g) only applied to contracts or orders entered into before November 23, 2013.</p>
                    <p id="p-14" data-page="61017">4. Added the definition of &ldquo;established price&rdquo; at FAR 16.001 to be consistent with the term as defined at the FAR clauses at FAR 52.216-2, Economic Price Adjustment&mdash;Standard Supplies, and 52.216-3, Economic Price Adjustment&mdash;Semistandard Supplies. This is an editorial change for consistency to have the definition in both the clause and the corresponding FAR part.</p>
                    <p id="p-15" data-page="61017">5. Made conforming changes to cross references, and the following Standard Forms (SF): SF 294, Subcontracting Report for Individual Contracts; SF 1443, Contractor's Request for Progress Payment; and SF 1449, Solicitation/Contract/Order for Commercial Products and Commercial Services. Also, minor editorial changes were made as needed throughout the FAR. These revisions do not impact terms and conditions of commercial contracts or how the Government procures commercial products or commercial services.</p>
                    <p id="p-16" data-page="61017">Three respondents submitted comments on the proposed rule.</p>
                    <h2 id="h-8">II. Discussion and Analysis</h2>
                    <p id="p-17" data-page="61017">The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council (the Councils) reviewed the public comments in the development of the final rule. A discussion of the comments and the changes made to the rule as a result of those comments are provided as follows:</p>

                    <p id="p-18" data-page="61017">There are no significant changes from the proposed rule.</p>
                    <h3 id="h-10">B. Analysis of Public Comments</h3>
                    <p id="p-19" data-page="61017">Of the three responses received, none provided negative comments on the rule, although they suggested changes as described below. No changes resulted from the public comments.</p>
                    <p id="p-20" data-page="61017">
                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         A respondent expressed that paragraph (1) of the commercial product definition in the proposed rule is not consistent with the language in <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/103" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 103(1)</a>. This respondent stated that while the wording for both definitions is very similar, the structure of the definition as promulgated in current law indicates it was the intent of Congress that for a product to meet the definition of a commercial product under paragraph (1), it must have been sold, leased, or licensed, or offered for sale, lease, or license, to the general public.

                        <em>Response:</em>
                         The Councils note that the respondent's quoted definition is similar to the statutory definition, and to the definition used in the proposed rule. No change is necessary.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         Two respondents suggested to explicitly include commercial services under the definition of commercial-off-the-shelf (&ldquo;COTS&rdquo;) items to provide the Government access to the broadest range of service providers. One respondent pointed to the following benefits: increase competition and allow Government customers quicker access to required commercial services. A respondent suggested to, at least, clarify that commercial wireless telecommunications offerings constitute a &ldquo;commercial product&rdquo; and thus can satisfy all definitional elements of COTS items.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-23" data-page="61018">
                        <em>Response:</em>
                         The Councils cannot accept the suggestions because they are not consistent with the statute being implemented. Section 836 of the NDAA for FY 2019 did not modify the definition of COTS item.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="h-11">C. Other Changes</h3>
                    <p id="p-24" data-page="61018">Other changes made in the final rule are as follows:</p>
                    
            <ul class="bullets" >
          <li id="p-25" data-page="61018">Revisions were made to account for additional instances of the term &ldquo;commercial item&rdquo; in the FAR after the proposed rule was published in the following sections: FAR 9.110-4(b), 9.110-5, 9.405-1, 39.205(a)(3) and (c)(3), 43.105(c), 52.209-14(d)(1), 52.229-13(c), and 52.229-14(c).</li>
                    <li id="p-26" data-page="61018">Three changes missed in the proposed rule were added as follows: the heading of FAR subpart 12.1, the word &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; at FAR 15.601, and the inclusion of &ldquo;commercial products&rdquo; in 52.212-5(b)(36).</li>
                    <li id="p-27" data-page="61018">Prescriptive language was relocated from the introductory text for the FAR clauses at 52.216-2, 52.216-3, and 52.216-4 to FAR 16.203-4(a)(4), (b)(6), and (c)(5), respectively, to be consistent with FAR drafting conventions.</li>
            </ul>
          
                    <h2 id="h-12">III. Applicability to Contracts at or Below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT) and for Commercial Products (Including Commercially Available Off-the-Shelf (COTS) Items), or for Commercial Services</h2>
                    <p id="p-28" data-page="61018">This rule does not create new solicitation provisions or contract clauses. This rule merely replaces the term &ldquo;commercial item(s)&rdquo; with &ldquo;commercial product(s),&rdquo; &ldquo;commercial service(s),&rdquo; &ldquo;commercial product(s) or commercial service(s),&rdquo; or &ldquo;commercial product(s) and commercial service(s)&rdquo; in the FAR including in part 52, as appropriate. This rule does not impose any new requirements on contracts at or below the SAT or for commercial products, including COTS items, or for commercial services.</p>
                    <h2 id="h-13">IV. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563</h2>
                    <p id="p-29" data-page="61018">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993.</p>

                        <p id="p-32" data-page="61018">This final rule amends the FAR to change the definition of &ldquo;commercial item&rdquo; by splitting it into the definitions of &ldquo;commercial product&rdquo; and &ldquo;commercial service&rdquo;.</p>

For many commercial products or commercial services, the criteria need not be more detailed than technical (capability of the item offered to meet the agency need), price, and past performance. Technical capability may be evaluated by how well the proposed products or services meet the Government requirement instead of predetermined subfactors. Solicitations for commercial products or commercial services do not have to contain subfactors for technical capability when the solicitation adequately describes the intended use of the commercial product or commercial service. A technical evaluation would normally include examination of such things as product or service literature, product samples (if requested), technical features, and warranty provisions. Past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with the procedures in section 13.106 or subpart 15.3, as applicable. The contracting officer shall ensure the instructions provided in the provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors&mdash;Commercial Products and Commercial Services, and the evaluation criteria provided in the provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation&mdash;Commercial Products and Commercial Services, are in agreement.</p>
