                <h1 id="h-6">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</h1>
                <h2 id="h-7">A. Background</h2>
                <p id="p-6" data-page="54527">DoD published an interim rule at <a href="/citation/75-FR-10190" class="fr-reference" data-reference="75 FR 10190">75 FR 10190</a> on March 5, 2010, to implement section 812 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/111/public/84" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 111-84</a>), enacted October 28, 2009. Section 812 was entitled &ldquo;Revision of Defense Supplement Relating to Payment of Costs Prior to Definitization.&rdquo; The interim rule amended the definition of &ldquo;contract action&rdquo; at DFARS 217.7401(a) to include task orders and delivery orders. This had the effect of making task orders and delivery orders subject to DoD's policies and procedures for undefinitized contract actions.</p>
                <p id="p-7" data-page="54527">The period for public comment closed on May 5, 2010. DoD received no comments on the interim rule. Therefore, DoD is finalizing the interim rule without change.</p>
                <p id="p-8" data-page="54527">This rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">Executive Order 12866</a>, dated September 30, 1993. This is not a major rule under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/804" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 804</a>.</p>
                <h2 id="h-8">B. Regulatory Flexibility Act</h2>
                <p id="p-9" data-page="54527">
                    DoD certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>, 
                    <em>et seq.</em>
                     No comments from small businesses were received during the public comment period, and the changes impose no additional requirements on small businesses that will impact substantially the way they do business with DoD.
                </p>
                <h2 id="h-9">C. Paperwork Reduction Act</h2>
                <p id="p-10" data-page="54527">
                    The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the rule does not impose any information collection requirements that require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/44/3501" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44 U.S.C. 3501</a>,
