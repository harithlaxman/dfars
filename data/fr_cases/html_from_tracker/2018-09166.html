                    <h2 id="h-7">I. Background</h2>
                    <p id="p-7" data-page="19146">DoD, GSA, and NASA are amending the FAR to reflect sections of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/114/public/328" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 114-328</a>), which amend the Small Business Act to provide additional duties for OSDBUs. By operation of <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/144" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 144(b)</a>, these additional duties also apply to OSBPs. Section 1812, paragraph (a) of section 1813, and paragraph (b) of section 1821 of the NDAA for FY 2017 amend section 15(k) of the Small Business Act to add duties for OSDBUs and OSBPs.</p>
                    <p id="p-8" data-page="19146">
                        Section 1812 of the NDAA for FY 2017 amends the Small Business Act to specifically reference the existing duties of OSDBUs and OSBPs with respect to the various small business programs and consolidation of contract requirements. Section 1812 also requires that OSDBUs and OSBPs review summary purchase card data for acquisitions above the micro-purchase threshold (
                        <em>e.g.,</em>
                         $3,500), but below the simplified acquisition threshold (
                        <em>e.g.,</em>
                         $150,000), to ensure these acquisitions are compliant with the Small Business Act and have been properly recorded in the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS). The revision to the FAR reflecting section 1812 of the NDAA includes flexibility for each OSDBU or OSBP to identify the best purchase card data available to their agency when implementing the statutory requirement.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-9" data-page="19146">Paragraph (a) of section 1813 requires OSDBUs and OSBPs to provide assistance to a small business prime contractor or subcontractor in finding resources for education and training on compliance with the FAR after award of their contract or subcontract.</p>
                    <p id="p-10" data-page="19146">Paragraph (b) of section 1821 requires OSDBUs and OSBPs to review all required small business subcontracting plans to ensure that they provide maximum practicable opportunity for small business concerns to participate as subcontractors.</p>
                    <p id="p-11" data-page="19146">Currently, acquisition-related duties of OSDBUs and OSBPs are found in FAR 19.201, General policy. The duties found in FAR 19.201 are based on the duties found in section 15(k) of the Small Business Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/15/644" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15 U.S.C. 644(k)</a>). Additional OSDBU and OSBP acquisition-related duties enacted before the NDAA for FY 2017 listed at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/15/644" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15 U.S.C. 644(k)</a>, which were not previously updated in the FAR, are also included in this rule.</p>
                    <p id="p-12" data-page="19146">Additionally, this rule revises the OSDBU and OSBP duty at FAR 19.201(c)(5), which relates to increasing small business participation in solicitations that involve bundling. This revision reflects that OSDBUs and OSBPs perform much broader functions under those scenarios than what is currently listed in the FAR.</p>
                    <h2 id="h-8">II. Publication of This Final Rule for Public Comment Is Not Required by Statute</h2>
                    <p id="p-13" data-page="19146">
                        The statute that applies to the publication of the FAR is the Office of Federal Procurement Policy statute (codified at title 41 of the United States Code). Specifically, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1707" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1707(a)(1)</a> requires that a procurement policy,

                        regulation, procedure, or form (including an amendment or modification thereof) must be published for public comment if it relates to the expenditure of appropriated funds, and has either a significant effect beyond the internal operating procedures of the agency issuing the policy, regulation, procedure, or form, or has a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors. While this final rule relates to the expenditure of appropriated funds, it is not required to be published for public comment because it does not have a significant effect or impose any requirements on contractors or offerors; the rule only provides information to contracting officers. This information affects only the internal operating procedures of the Government.

                    <p id="p-14" data-page="19147">This rule amends FAR 19.201, General policy. The objective of the rule is to update the list of duties for OSDBUs and OSBPs in line with section 15(k) of the Small Business Act. No clauses or provisions are being created or revised by this rule.</p>
                    <h2 id="h-10">IV. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563</h2>
                    <p id="p-15" data-page="19147">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under Section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993.

                        <em>et seq.</em>) does not apply to this rule, because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment are not required to be given for this rule under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1707" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1707(a)(1)</a> (see section II. of this preamble).
