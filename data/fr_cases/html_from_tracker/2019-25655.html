                <p id="p-7" data-page="65308">
                    DoD published a proposed rule in the 
                    <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                     at <a href="/citation/84-FR-39254" class="fr-reference" data-reference="84 FR 39254">84 FR 39254</a> on August 9, 2019, to implement section 837 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/115/public/91" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 115-91</a>). Section 837 requires an amendment to the DFARS to provide for the appropriate use of the should-cost review process of a major weapon system in a manner that is transparent, objective, and provides for the efficiency of the systems acquisition process in the Department of Defense. There were no public comments submitted in response to the proposed rule. There are no changes from the proposed rule made in the final rule.

                <h2 id="h-8">II. Applicability to Contracts at or Below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold and for Commercial Items, Including Commercially Available Off-the-Shelf Items</h2>
                <p id="p-8" data-page="65308">This rule create a new clause at DFARS 252.215-7015, Program Should-Cost Review, but this clause is not applicable to contracts valued at or below the simplified acquisition threshold or for the acquisition of commercial items, including commercially available off-the-shelf items. Contracts for the development and or production of a major weapon system do not include contracts valued at or below the simplified acquisition threshold and are unlikely to include contracts for commercial items.</p>
                <h2 id="h-9">III. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563</h2>
                <p id="p-9" data-page="65308">Executive Order (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993.

                <p id="p-11" data-page="65308">
                    A final regulatory flexibility analysis (FRFA) has been prepared consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>, 
                    <em>et seq.</em>
                     The FRFA is summarized as follows:

                </p>
                <p id="p-12" data-page="65309">This action is necessary to implement section 837 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2018. Section 837 requires an amendment to the DFARS to provide for the appropriate use of the should-cost review process of a major weapon system in a manner that is transparent, objective and provides for the efficiency of the systems acquisition process in the Department of Defense.</p>
                <p id="p-13" data-page="65309">The objective of this rule is to amend the DFARS to include six elements, at a minimum, regarding the appropriate use of the should-cost review of a major weapon system: (1) A description of the features of the should-cost review process, (2) establishment of a process for communicating with the prime contractor on the program the elements of a proposed should-cost review, (3) a method for ensuring that identified should-cost savings opportunities are based on accurate, complete, and current information and can be quantified and tracked, (4) a description of the training, skills, and experience that Department of Defense and contractor officials carrying out a should-cost review should possess, (5) a method for ensuring appropriate collaboration with the contractor throughout the review process, and (6) establishment of review process requirements that provide for sufficient analysis and minimize any impact on program schedule. The legal basis for these changes is section 837 of the NDAA for FY 2018.</p>
                <p id="p-14" data-page="65309">No public comments were received in response to the proposed rule.</p>
                <p id="p-15" data-page="65309">This rule only applies to contracts for the development and or production of a major systems, as defined in FAR 2.101. DoD estimates that there are 150 major systems, which include major weapon systems. DoD estimates that the prime contractors for major systems are other than small business and only one program should-cost review occurs per year for major systems, so this rule will have minimal impact on small businesses.</p>
                <p id="p-16" data-page="65309">This final rule does not include any new reporting, recordkeeping, or other compliance requirements for small businesses.</p>
                <p id="p-17" data-page="65309">There are no known significant alternative approaches to the rule that would meet the objectives. There is no significant economic impact on small entities.</p>

                <p id="p-18" data-page="65309">The rule does not contain any information collection requirements that require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/44/3501" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44 U.S.C. chapter 35</a>).</p>
