                <h2 id="h-7">I. Background</h2>
                <p id="p-7" data-page="18877">
                    DoD published an interim rule in the 
                    <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                     at <a href="/citation/77-FR-31536" class="fr-reference" data-reference="77 FR 31536">77 FR 31536</a> on May 29, 2012, to implement the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/112/public/42" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 112-42</a>) (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/19/3805" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">19 U.S.C. 3805 note</a>).
                </p>
                <p id="p-8" data-page="18877">No public comments were received. Therefore, DoD is adopting the interim rule as final, without change.</p>
                <h2 id="h-8">II. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563</h2>
                <p id="p-9" data-page="18877">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993. This rule is not a major rule under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/804" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 804</a>.</p>
                <h2 id="h-9">III. Regulatory Flexibility Act</h2>
                <p id="p-10" data-page="18877">
                    DoD certifies that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>, 
                    <em>et seq.</em>
                     Although the rule now opens up Government procurement to the goods and services of Colombia at or above the threshold of $77,494.00, DoD does not anticipate any significant economic impact on U.S. small businesses. DoD only applies the trade agreements to the non-defense items listed at DFARS 225.401-70, and acquisitions that are set aside or provide other forms of preference for small businesses are exempt. FAR 19.502-2 states that acquisitions that do not exceed $150,000 (with some exceptions) are automatically reserved exclusively for small business concerns.
                </p>
                <h2 id="h-10">IV. Paperwork Reduction Act</h2>
                <p id="p-11" data-page="18877">This rule affects the certification and information collection requirements in the provision 252.225-7035, currently approved under OMB Control Number 0704-0229, titled Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement Part 225, Foreign Acquisition, and related clauses, in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/44/3501" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44 U.S.C. chapter 35</a>). OMB Control Number 0704-0229 assessed the total burden related to part 225 at approximately 57,230 hours. The impact, however, is negligible, because it is just a question of under which category offered goods from Colombia would be listed.</p>
