                <h2 id="h-7">I. Background</h2>
                <p id="p-6" data-page="22041">
                    DoD published an interim rule in the 
                    <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                     at <a href="/citation/78-FR-76993" class="fr-reference" data-reference="78 FR 76993">78 FR 76993</a> on December 20, 2013, to clarify rules of origin under trade agreements for photovoltaic devices to be utilized under covered DoD contracts, as required by a section of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011. One respondent submitted a public comment in response to the interim rule.
                </p>
                <h2 id="h-8">II. Discussion and Analysis</h2>
                <p id="p-7" data-page="22041">DoD reviewed the public comment in the development of the final rule. The interim rule was converted to a final rule without change. The one comment received related to performance of a net zero green house gas analysis, and was outside the scope of the rule.</p>
                <h2 id="h-9">III. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563</h2>
                <p id="p-8" data-page="22041">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993. This rule is not a major rule under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/804" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 804</a>.</p>
                <h2 id="h-10">IV. Regulatory Flexibility Act</h2>
                <p id="p-9" data-page="22041">
                    DoD certifies that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>, 
                    <em>et seq.,</em>
                     because this rule will only have an impact on the determination of whether photovoltaic devices are substantially transformed in a designated country. No domestic entities will be impacted because the United States is not a designated country. For the definition of &ldquo;small business,&rdquo; the Regulatory Flexibility Act refers to the Small Business Act, which in turn allows the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) Administrator to specify detailed definitions or standards (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601(3)</a> and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/15/632" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15 U.S.C. 632(a)</a>). The SBA regulations at <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-13/section-121.105" class="cfr external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">13 CFR 121.105</a> discuss who is a small business: &ldquo;(a)(1) Except for small agricultural cooperatives, a business concern eligible for assistance from SBA as a small business is a business entity organized for profit, with a place of business located in the United States, and which operates primarily within the United States or which makes a significant contribution to the U.S. economy through payment of taxes or use of American products, materials or labor.

                <h2 id="h-11">V. Paperwork Reduction Act</h2>
                <p id="p-10" data-page="22041">
                    The rule contains information collection requirements that require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/44/3501" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44 U.S.C. chapter 35</a>); however, these changes to the DFARS do not impose additional information
