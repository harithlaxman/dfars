                        DoD published a proposed rule in the 
                        <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                         at <a href="/citation/80-FR-72671" class="fr-reference" data-reference="80 FR 72671">80 FR 72671</a> on November 20, 2015, to revise the DFARS to implement section 811 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/113/public/291" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 113-291</a>, enacted December 19, 2014), which amended paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 819 of the NDAA for FY 2010 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2302" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2302 note</a>). The rule proposed to amend DFARS 217.202(2) and 234.005-1(1) to add &ldquo;or initial production&rdquo; to the text, to allow for inclusion of a contract line item (possibly an option) for advanced component development and prototype units to go to initial production without further competition. The rule also proposed to amend DFARS 234.005-1(2) to extend this authority to September 30, 2019. There were no public comments submitted in response to the proposed rule. There are no changes from the proposed rule made in the final rule.

                    <h2 id="h-8">II. Applicability to Contracts at or Below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold and for Commercial Items, Including Commercially Available Off-the-Shelf Items</h2>
                    <p id="p-8" data-page="17044">This case does not add any new provisions or clauses or impact any existing provisions or clauses.</p>
                    <h2 id="h-9">III. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563</h2>
                    <p id="p-9" data-page="17044">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993. This rule is not a major rule under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/804" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 804</a>.</p>

                    <p id="p-10" data-page="17044">
                        DoD has prepared a Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (FRFA) consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>, 
                        <em>et seq.</em>
                         The FRFA is summarized as follows:
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-11" data-page="17044">This rule is necessary to implement section 811 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/113/public/291" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 113-291</a>). Section 811 amends paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 819 of the NDAA for FY 2010 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2302" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2302 note</a>). The objective of this rule is to provide authority for the inclusion of a contract line item (possibly an option) for advanced component development and prototype units to go to initial production without further competition.</p>
                    <p id="p-12" data-page="17044">
                        There were no significant issues raised by the public in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis.

                    </p>
                    <p id="p-13" data-page="17045">The rule will apply to DoD major defense acquisition program contractors and subcontractors. Most major defense acquisition programs are awarded to large concerns as they are of a scope too large for any small business to perform. As such, it is not expected that this rule will have a significant impact on a significant number of small entities.</p>
                    <p id="p-14" data-page="17045">This rule does not impose new recordkeeping or reporting requirements. There are no known significant alternative approaches to the rule that would meet the requirements of the statute.</p>

                    <p id="p-15" data-page="17045">The rule does not contain any information collection requirements that require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/44/3501" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44 U.S.C. chapter 35</a>).</p>
