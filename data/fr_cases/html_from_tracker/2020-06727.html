                    DoD published a proposed rule in the 
                    <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                     at <a href="/citation/84-FR-25225" class="fr-reference" data-reference="84 FR 25225">84 FR 25225</a> on May 31, 2019, to implement section 852 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/115/public/232" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub.

                <p id="p-12" data-page="19693">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     One respondent expressed overall support for the proposed rule if the rule ensures all large business prime contractors are required to pay their subcontractors within 15 days of receiving an invoice from their small business subcontractors, regardless of whether the prime has been paid by the Federal Government. Another respondent suggested an authority to enforce, and a forum to address, grievances for payments from the Government that are past due.
                </p>
                <p id="p-13" data-page="19693">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     This final rule incorporates the statutory language of section 852 of the NDAA for FY 2019, as implemented via <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2307" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2307</a>, which establishes the 15-day timeframe as a goal, rather than a firm deadline. The rule provides for prime contractors to make accelerated payments to small business subcontractors after receipt of payment from the Government because a prime contractor who subcontracts with small businesses could be a small business itself. Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 32.9 implements the statutory requirements concerning required documentation for invoice and acceptance, the establishment of payment due dates, and the payment of late payment interest penalties after the due date established under the Prompt Payment Act (
                    <em>e.g.,</em>
                     30 days). DoD payment offices must adhere to these requirements and make payments as quickly as possible, to the fullest extent permitted by law.
                </p>
                <p id="p-14" data-page="19693">Concerning the respondent's suggestion regarding a forum to address late payments, as prescribed in <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-5/section-1315.18" class="cfr external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 CFR 1315.18</a>, questions concerning delinquent payments should be directed to the designated agency office, or the office responsible for issuing the payment if different from the designated agency office. Questions about disagreements over payment amount or timing should be directed to the contracting officer for resolution. Small business concerns may obtain additional assistance on payment issues by contacting the agency's Office of Small Business Programs.</p>
                <h4 id="h-13">3. Interest Penalties for Late Payments to Subcontractors</h4>
                <p id="p-15" data-page="19693">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     One respondent suggested that the rule could be improved by also imposing an interest penalty on all small business invoices submitted to the prime contractor that are not paid within 15 days of receipt. Another respondent recommended an authority for the Government to pay interest penalties to both contractors when invoices are past due.
                </p>
                <p id="p-16" data-page="19693">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     Section 852 does not provide for interest penalties to be paid by the prime contractor for late payments to a subcontractor. Therefore, this final rule does not impose interest penalties beyond those implemented in FAR subpart 32.9 under the Prompt Payment Act. The subcontract between the prime contractor and the subcontractor is a business arrangement between two private parties, and therefore Prompt Payment Act interest penalties do not apply.
                </p>
                <h4 id="h-14">4. 15-Day Payment Goal</h4>
                <p id="p-17" data-page="19693">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     Two respondents expressed a preference for the proposed rule to mandate prompt payment instead of making it a goal, however, they commended the DoD proposal to revise the DFARS to implement section 852 of the NDAA for FY 2019 to pay small businesses within 15 days, rather than the current 30-day standard. It is viewed as an important first step for DoD small business contractors. Two other respondents stated that FAR 52.232-40 does not provide for the 15-day payment goal &ldquo;to the fullest extent permitted by law,&rdquo; which creates a conflict with the specific 15-day goal that section 852 directs DoD to adopt. One of the respondents recommends a new DFARS prescription and contract clause to supplement FAR 52.232-40 be added that provides for the 15-day payment goal &ldquo;to the fullest extent permitted by law.&rdquo; The respondent supports the revision to DFARS 232.903 to comport with the provisions of section 852 with respect to small business prime contractors.
                </p>
                <p id="p-18" data-page="19693">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     DoD recognizes the respondents' preference to mandate payment within 15 days instead of making it a goal; and agrees that the goal is an important step for small business contractors working with the DoD. DoD also affirms support for the revision to DFARS 232.903 to implement the provisions of section 852.
                </p>
                <p id="p-19" data-page="19693">Regarding a conflict with the FAR, this final DFARS rule provides details to supplement, rather than conflict with, the requirements of FAR 52.232-40, Providing Accelerated Payments to Small Business Subcontractors. The rule relies on the FAR clause and the DFARS clause at 252.232-7017, used together in a contract, to communicate to prime contractors the requirements concerning accelerated payments. See section III of this preamble for a more detailed explanation of how the clauses are used together. DoD agrees that it is important to clarify what constitutes an accelerated payment from a prime contractor to a small business subcontractor in the context of this DFARS rule. Therefore, the final rule revises the clause at DFARS 252.232-7017 to define &ldquo;accelerated payment&rdquo; as a payment made to a small business subcontractor as quickly as possible, with a goal of 15 days or less after receipt of payment from the Government or receipt of a proper invoice from the subcontractor, whichever is later.</p>

                <p id="p-20" data-page="19693">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     One respondent suggested that the definition of small business subcontractors be clarified for the purposes of accelerated payments as those that are directly supporting or charged to a DoD contract in which the prime contractor is receiving accelerated payments (
                    <em>i.e.,</em>
                     not those supporting indirect, commercial, or foreign efforts by the prime contractor).

                <p id="p-21" data-page="19693">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     This final rule does not provide a definition of &ldquo;small business subcontractor.&rdquo; This term is defined at FAR 2.101. The definition provided in the FAR applies to the DFARS, including this rule.
                </p>
                <h4 id="h-17">b. Section Heading for DFARS 232.009</h4>
                <p id="p-22" data-page="19693">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     One respondent suggested that the heading to DFARS 232.009 be changed to read &ldquo;Providing accelerated payments to small business contractors and small business subcontractors&rdquo; because DFARS 232.009-1 adds coverage for both small business and small business subcontractors. In addition, the respondent suggested that the term &ldquo;small business primes&rdquo; in

                    both DFARS 232.009 and DFARS 232.009-1 would be clearer than &ldquo;small business contractor&rdquo;.
                </p>
                <p id="p-23" data-page="19694">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The final rule does not include the respondent's suggested edits. Revising the heading of DFARS 232.009 as suggested would create a disconnect with the title of the new contract clause prescribed in this section. In addition, DFARS 232.009 is numbered to correspond to FAR 32.009, which addresses the same subject matter. This drafting convention allows contracting officers to locate more easily coverage of similar topics in the FAR and DFARS. It is not necessary to add &ldquo;prime contractors&rdquo; to the heading because, in the FAR and DFARS, the term &ldquo;contractor&rdquo; means the prime contractor.

                <p id="p-24" data-page="19694">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     One respondent stated that section 852 addresses two types of accelerated payments, but noted both are applicable to DoD only. The first type addresses payments to small business prime contractors; the second type addresses payments to any DoD prime contractor that subcontracts with small businesses. The respondent indicated a preference for both types of accelerated payments to be made applicable governmentwide. The respondent also stated that, at a minimum, the rule should acknowledge the governmentwide application of making accelerated payments to small business prime contractors, as provided for in FAR clause 52.232-25, Prompt Payment.

                    <em>Response:</em>
                     DoD affirms the respondent's statement that section 852 of the NDAA for FY 2019 applies to DoD only. As such, this final DFARS rule will be applicable to DoD only. DoD notes, however, that FAR Case 2020-007, Accelerated Payments Applicable to Contracts with Certain Small Business Concerns, is in process to implement section 873 of the NDAA for FY 2020, which modifies <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/31/3903" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">31 U.S.C. 3903(a)</a> to require accelerated payments for small business prime contractors and prime contractors that subcontract with small business concerns.

                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     One respondent expressed concern that the rule could be improved by defining what constitutes a small business.

                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The FAR defines &ldquo;small business concern&rdquo; in subpart 2.1, Definitions. The definition of &ldquo;small business concern&rdquo; in the FAR applies throughout the DFARS, including to this rule.

                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     One respondent commented on DoD's inability to estimate the number of small business subcontractors who have been required to pay fees or provide consideration in return for accelerated payments from prime contractors, or the dollar value of these fees or consideration. The respondent asked if it was feasible to survey a sample of subcontractors to DoD prime contractors regarding the average fees paid to the prime contractors, and use that data to estimate fees paid by subcontractors to DoD prime contractors in general. The respondent also asked if the contractors could be sorted by size (
                    <em>i.e.,</em>
                     small, medium, and large), with an average fee for each size contractor, to find a weighted average number of contractors and fee.

                    <em>Response:</em>
                     Resources are not available for a survey such as the respondent suggested. DoD does not have any data on which to base an estimate of the number of subcontractors required to pay fees or provide consideration to the prime contractor in return for accelerated payments, or the dollar value of the fees or consideration. Public comments did not provide insight into whether small business subcontractors had been required to pay fees or provide consideration for accelerated payments, or the dollar value of such fees or consideration.

                    Current DoD policy, as stated in DFARS 232.903, is to pay small business contractors as quickly as possible after receipt of invoices and proper documentation. This rule specifies that DoD will provide payment as quickly as possible, to the fullest extent permitted by law, with a goal of 15 days after receipt of proper invoices and documentation, and before normal payment due dates. For items that ordinarily require payment in less than 15 days (
                    <em>e.g.,</em>

DoD agrees that it is important to clarify what constitutes an accelerated payment from a prime contractor to a small business subcontractor in the context of this DFARS rule. Therefore, the final rule revises the clause at DFARS 252.232-7017, Accelerating Payments to Small Business Subcontractors&mdash;Prohibition on Fees and Consideration, to clarify that &ldquo;accelerated payment&rdquo; means &ldquo;a payment made to a small business subcontractor as quickly as possible, with a goal of 15 days or less after receipt of payment from the Government or receipt of a proper invoice from the subcontractor, whichever is later.&rdquo; See paragraph (e) for an explanation of how the FAR clause and the DFARS clause will be used together to provide for accelerated payments to small business subcontractors.

DoD's subject matter experts from the Defense Finance and Accounting Service and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) have provided clarification on the circumstances that could result in DoD not providing accelerated payments to small businesses.

With regard to the impact of the prohibition on fees or other consideration in return for accelerated payments, it is not possible for DoD to estimate how many of these small business subcontractors may have been required to provide consideration or pay fees to the prime contractor in order to receive accelerated payments.
