                    <p id="p-6" data-page="27494">A summary for the FAR rule follows. For the actual revisions and/or amendments made by this FAR Case, refer to the specific subject set forth in the document following this item summary. FAC 2019-03 amends the FAR as follows:</p>
                    <h2 id="h-7">Exception From Certified Cost or Pricing Data Requirements&mdash;Adequate Price Competition (FAR Case 2017-006)</h2>
                    <p id="p-7" data-page="27494">This final rule amends the FAR to provide guidance to DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, consistent with section 822 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 that addresses the exception from certified cost or pricing data requirements when price is based on adequate price competition. Section 822 excludes from the standard for adequate price competition the situation in which there was an expectation of competition, but only one offer is received. The standard of adequate price competition that is based on a reasonable expectation of competition is now applicable only to agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.</p>
                    <p id="p-8" data-page="27494">This final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.</p>
