                    <h2 id="h-7">I. Background</h2>
                    <p id="p-7" data-page="19145">Section 835 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/114/public/328" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 114-328</a>) was enacted December 23, 2016. Section 835(a) amended <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2304c" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2304c(e)(1)(B)</a> to raise the threshold for task- and delivery-order protests from $10 million to $25 million (applicable to DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard). Section 835(b) amended <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/4106" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 4106(f)</a> to repeal the sunset date of September 30, 2016, of the authority to protest the placement of an order (for the other civilian agencies). The sunset date was already repealed on December 14, 2016, by the GAO Civilian Task and Delivery Order Protest Authority Act of 2016 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/114/public/260" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 114-260</a>).</p>
                    <h2 id="h-8">II. Discussion and Analysis</h2>
                    <p id="p-8" data-page="19145">This final rule amends FAR 16.505(a)(10) to raise the threshold for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard from $10 million to $25 million and remove the sunset date for the other civilian agencies.</p>
                    <h2 id="h-9">III. Expected Cost Savings</h2>
                    <p id="p-9" data-page="19145">The rule is administrative in nature&mdash;it follows the statute exactly, raising a threshold and removing a sunset date.</p>
                    <p id="p-10" data-page="19145">Currently, FAR 16.505(a)(10)(i) prohibits any protest in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of an order under a task-order contract or delivery-order contract, except for a protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract; or the order is valued in excess of $10 million. This FAR change implements section 835 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 to&mdash;</p>
                    
            <ul class="bullets" >
          <li id="p-11" data-page="19145">Raise the threshold at which a protest may be filed at the Government Accountability Office (GAO) for task or delivery orders from $10 million to $25 million, applicable only to DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard; and</li>
                    <li id="p-12" data-page="19145">Remove the sunset date (September 30, 2016) for the authority to protest the placement of an order for agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.</li>
            </ul>
          
                    <p id="p-13" data-page="19145">Although, according to GAO, there are fewer than 10 protests per year of procurements between $10 million and $25 million, the higher threshold for protests of task or delivery orders for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard will result in savings for GAO and the affected Executive branch agencies, because there will no longer be protests of orders valued between $10 million and $25 million based on dollar value. While it is difficult to quantify, the lost benefit to interested parties who will lose the right to protest as a result of this rule is likely de minimis, given the historical data from GAO indicating a small number of protests in the affected dollar range. Further, there are some benefits to offerors or contractors who win awards and will no longer need to expend resources defending challenges to the award. Therefore, the net burden of this rule is estimated as less than zero, though the FAR Council is not able to monetize cost savings.</p>
                    <h2 id="h-10">IV. Applicability to Contracts at or Below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold and for Commercial Items, Including Commercially Available Off-the-Shelf Items</h2>
                    <p id="p-14" data-page="19145">This rule does not add any new solicitation provisions or clauses, or impact any existing provisions or clauses.</p>
                    <h2 id="h-11">V. Publication of This Final Rule for Public Comment Is Not Required by Statute</h2>
                    <p id="p-15" data-page="19145">The statute that applies to the publication of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) is the Office of Federal Procurement Policy statute (codified at Title 41 of the United States Code). Specifically, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1707" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1707(a)(1)</a> requires that a procurement policy, regulation, procedure, or form (including an amendment or modification thereof) must be published for public comment if it relates to the expenditure of appropriated funds, and has either a significant effect beyond the internal operating procedures of the agency issuing the policy, regulation, procedure, or form, or has a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors. This final rule is not required to be published for public comment, because it follows the statute exactly, raising a threshold and removing a sunset date.</p>
                    <h2 id="h-12">VI. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563</h2>
                    <p id="p-16" data-page="19145">
                        Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993.
