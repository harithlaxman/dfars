                <p id="p-6" data-page="73240">DoD is issuing a final rule amending the DFARS to implement section 1025 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/116/public/283" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 116-283</a>), which amends <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/8680" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 8680(a)</a> to restrict the overhaul or repair of a naval vessel in a shipyard outside the United States or Guam. The restriction does not apply to voyage repairs or to repairs required for damage sustained due to hostile actions or interventions. In addition, the restriction does not apply to a naval vessel classified as a littoral combat ship operating on deployment for corrective and preventive maintenance or repair and facilities maintenance. The rule also establishes the criteria under which foreign workers or foreign contractors may be used to perform corrective and preventive maintenance or repair or facilities maintenance on a naval vessel.</p>
                <p id="p-7" data-page="73240">
                    DoD published a proposed rule in the 
                    <strong>Federal Register</strong>

                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     A respondent provided comments with overall support of the rule and stated it would save money and reduce the need for supplies and preventative maintenance on ships in foreign shipyards.

                <p id="p-12" data-page="73240">Minor editorial changes are made in paragraph (b) of DFARS 225.7013-2 to comply with drafting conventions.</p>

                <p id="p-13" data-page="73240">This rule does not create any new solicitation provisions or contract clauses. It does not impact any existing solicitation provisions or contract clauses or prescriptions for their use.</p>
                <h2 id="h-13">IV. Expected Impact of the Rule</h2>
                <p id="p-14" data-page="73240">Currently, DFARS 225.7013 includes the restrictions on the construction or repair of vessels in foreign shipyards. This rule adds the exception for repairs necessary to correct damage sustained due to hostile actions or interventions and for corrective and preventive maintenance or repair and facilities maintenance on naval vessels classified as littoral combat ships operating on deployment. Under these exceptions, the repairs or maintenance described above may be performed in a shipyard outside the United States or Guam in accordance with <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/8680" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 8680(a)</a>. The rule also specifies the authorized use of foreign workers under certain conditions when a determination is made by the Secretary of the Navy, who cannot further delegate the authority to make such a determination.</p>
                <h2 id="h-14">V. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563</h2>
                <p id="p-15" data-page="73240">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, as amended.</p>
                <h2 id="h-15">VI. Congressional Review Act</h2>

A major rule under the Congressional Review Act cannot take effect until 60 days after it is published in the 
                    <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                    . The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has determined that this rule is not a major rule as defined by <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/804" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 804</a>.

                    A final regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>, 
                    <em>et seq.</em>
                     and is summarized as follows:

                <p id="p-18" data-page="73240">
                    DoD is issuing a final rule amending the DFARS to implement section 1025 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/116/public/283" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub.

The final rule also establishes that: (1) foreign workers may not be used to perform corrective and preventive maintenance or repair on a naval vessel unless the

                    Secretary of the Navy (without further delegation) makes a determination; and (2) foreign contractors may not be used to perform facilities maintenance unless approved by the Secretary of the Navy. The objective of the rule is to implement the restrictions of section 1025 of the NDAA for FY 2021 on the overhaul or repair of a naval vessel in a shipyard outside the United States or Guam, with exceptions as described in this paragraph.

                <p id="p-19" data-page="73241">No public comments were received in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis.</p>
                <p id="p-20" data-page="73241">DoD reviewed data from the Federal Procurement Data System for fiscal years 2020, 2021, and 2022 for contracts for the repair or overhaul of naval vessels outside the United States or Guam that exceeded the simplified acquisition threshold. DoD awarded a total of 383 contracts to an average of 76 unique small entities.</p>
                <p id="p-21" data-page="73241">It is expected that this rule will continue to provide small businesses the opportunity to participate in acquisitions for the overhaul or repair of a naval vessel in a shipyard outside the United States or Guam, since naval vessel overhaul restrictions currently exist, and this rule provides exceptions that allow for U.S. contractor personnel to perform certain repairs and maintenance in accordance with <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/8680" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 8680(a)</a>.</p>
                <p id="p-22" data-page="73241">This rule does not include any new reporting, recordkeeping, or other compliance requirements for small entities.</p>
                <p id="p-23" data-page="73241">There are no known significant alternative approaches to the rule that would meet the requirements of the statute.</p>

                <p id="p-24" data-page="73241">This rule does not contain any information collection requirements that require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/44/3501" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44 U.S.C. chapter 35</a>).</p>
