                    <p id="p-6" data-page="73902">DoD, GSA, and NASA published a proposed rule at <a href="/citation/81-FR-85914" class="fr-reference" data-reference="81 FR 85914">81 FR 85914</a> on November 29, 2016, to revise the FAR to implement section 887 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/114/public/92" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 114-92</a>). This provision provides that the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council shall prescribe a regulation making clear that agency acquisition personnel are permitted and encouraged to engage in responsible and constructive exchanges with industry, so long as those exchanges are consistent with existing law and regulation and do not promote an unfair competitive advantage to particular firms. Nineteen respondents submitted comments on the proposed rule.</p>
                    <h2 id="h-8">II. Discussion and Analysis</h2>
                    <p id="p-7" data-page="73902">The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council (the Councils) reviewed the public comments in the development of the final rule.</p>

                        Minor changes to the proposed rule are made as a result of public comments. At FAR 1.102-2(a)(4), first sentence, the words &ldquo;the commercial sector&rdquo; are deleted and replaced with the word &ldquo;industry&rdquo;, the word &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; is deleted, and FAR 1.102-2(a)(4), second sentence, the words &ldquo;as part of market research (see 10.002)&rdquo; are replaced with &ldquo;(

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         A number of respondents indicated that this rule should expand beyond FAR part 1.

                        <em>Response:</em>
                         This FAR case implements the requirement of section 887 in part 1; the Councils will carefully consider whether another FAR case would be beneficial to furthering the goal of effective communication. Regulatory coverage is just one of a number of ways in which meaningful dialogue is facilitated between the Government and contractors. For example, the Office of

                        Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) has issued &ldquo;myth-busting&rdquo; memoranda to dispel workforce misunderstandings about what communications are allowed. The Chief Acquisition Officers Council sponsors a Governmentwide knowledge management portal, known as the Periodic Table of Acquisition Innovations, which includes tested artifacts provided by agency acquisition innovation advocates to improve communication with prospective and actual offerors. Agency industry liaisons and small business specialists assist program and acquisition personnel in developing strategies for engaging potential vendors to build and maintain the diversity and resilience of the agency's supplier base, with small business specialists focused, in particular, on communications that can help bring socioeconomic and other small businesses to the base. OFPP has agreed to confer with agency acquisition innovation advocates, agency industry liaisons, and small business specialists, as well as program and project personnel whose programs are supported by contractors, review ideas on effective communication provided in response to crowdsourcing campaigns, and discuss feedback with the Councils.

                         A respondent stated that the rule should incentivize officials to enhance levels of communication without fear of reprimand.

                        <em>Response:</em>
                         The Councils believe the rule builds on existing guidance in FAR subpart 1.1 and FAR part 10, as well as the ongoing efforts by industry and Government to promote greater Government-vendor communications. Acquisition innovation advocates, industry liaisons, and OFPP's continued efforts are expected to help encourage Government acquisition personnel to engage with industry in accordance with existing law and regulation.

                         FAR 10.002(b)(2) covers market research techniques and the Councils believe that additional changes are not necessary at this time.

                         The Government acquisition personnel referenced in the rule includes key technical personnel. FAR 1.102(c) describes the acquisition team as including the technical, supply, and procurement communities and the customers they serve.

                         A respondent commented that before implementing this rule, the Councils should look at Community of Practice and agency communication plans, gather ideas, supplement the rule with non-exclusive list of ideas and crosswalk them to FAR parts 3, 13, 14, and 15.

                         The Councils reviewed several parts of the FAR that provide policy on exchanges between Government and industry. The Councils determined that amending FAR part 1 was the appropriate place in the FAR for this rule. FAR part 1 sets forth basic policies and general information about the Federal Acquisition Regulations System including FAR parts 3, 13, 14, and 15.

                         The FAR provides guidance and direction to the contracting workforce and industry. While the FAR sometimes implements guidance published by OFPP, the FAR does not provide direction to OFPP.

                        <em>Response:</em>
                         This change to the FAR encourages effective communication between Government and industry where appropriate. The rule is not a mandate, allowing contracting officers the discretion to use business judgment and best practices.

                         The rule amends the FAR to implement section 887 of the NDAA for FY 2016. The rule clarifies that agency acquisition personnel are permitted and encouraged to engage in responsible and constructive exchanges with industry, so long as those exchanges are consistent with existing law and regulation and do not promote an unfair competitive advantage to particular firms. Section 887 did not require communication actions, but clarified that they be permitted and encouraged.

                         A respondent noted that revising FAR 1.102 would not enhance communication between Government and industry because very few contracting officers read this part of the FAR or even know that it exists.

                         The revision in FAR 1.102 is meant to enhance communication between Government and industry when coupled with the existing guidance in FAR subpart 1.1 and the market research strategies set forth in FAR part 10. The rule will be disseminated in accordance with agency procedures to ensure that Government acquisition personnel are aware of the changes to FAR 1.102.

The Councils determined that amending FAR part 1 was the appropriate place in the FAR for this rule. FAR part 1 sets forth basic policies and general information about the Federal Acquisition Regulations System including FAR 15.201.

Within the context of this rulemaking, the reference to the memoranda in the preamble of the proposed rule served as an invitation for interested parties to share their assessment of the impediments to effective communication during the acquisition process. It was the intent of the Councils to obtain valuable insights from the community affected most by these challenges so as to develop innovative approaches for overcoming these obstacles in the future.

The public feedback will be valuable when developing further initiatives to address effective and efficient communications during the acquisition process.

                         The acquisition workforce is encouraged to use the wide range of techniques for conducting thorough market research as identified in the FAR and additional agency guidance. Market research is a critical step that informs key decisions in acquiring best value goods and services&mdash;while an effective and informed market research practice is important, it is only a building block that plays a part in the acquisition and affects future outcomes and practices. Effective market research enables agencies to gain an understanding of the marketplace and helps inform agencies on requirements development which in turn help drive strategy and future interactions with potential vendors.

                         Successful acquisitions that deliver best value are dependent on the work of various participants ranging from the program office, to the acquisition personnel, to executives leading the process, to the policy and strategic office, legal counsel, and many more. As an example, the Category Management Leadership Council (CMLC) is a council of representatives that come from the agencies who comprise the majority of Federal procurement spending. The Council representatives are agency Category Managers who are empowered to manage, structure, and help guide agency spending to make Federal procurements more efficient and cost effective.

                         A well-planned solicitation process is a valuable opportunity for agency acquisition personnel and potential vendors to interact and exchange information on the procurement. Industry days, as well as presolicitation and preproposal conferences, directly benefit the government by promoting a common understanding of the procurement requirements, the solicitation terms and conditions, and the evaluation criteria. Agency acquisition personnel are encouraged, when appropriate, to use interactive web-based technology to expand the reach of the exchange, such as a live webinar with streaming video to immediately address questions. Agency acquisition personnel are encouraged to combine such an approach with additional meetings available to all potential vendors to make solicitation engagements more useful, especially for large, complex requirements.

                        <em>Response:</em>
                         Improved communication with industry is a core element for driving better return from each dollar spent on acquisitions. To maximize the return on its acquisition investment and to ensure access to high-quality solutions, the acquisition workforce must ensure it conducts productive interactions with its industry partners and maximizes the guidance and instructions provided in the FAR. OFPP, in consultation with the Councils, will continue to evaluate the relevant FAR sections to ensure clear and accurate information. The Councils will carefully consider whether another FAR case is necessary to expound on communication beyond what is included in this FAR case.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         A respondent supported that encouraging or requiring discussions after establishing the competitive range could be beneficial to the procurement process to the extent that doing so would not further impede the procurement process or create unequal discussions. Another respondent supported the encouraging or requiring of discussions for contracts valued at twenty million dollars and above. Other respondents stated that encouraging or requiring discussions after establishing the competitive range could be beneficial and this decision should be based on complexity of the contract.

                         While agencies do not have the resources, and are not required, to meet with every vendor at every step of the acquisition process, information gathered from industry sources plays an invaluable role in the acquisition process. Industry partners are often the best source of information, so productive interactions between Federal agencies and the private sector are encouraged to ensure that the Government clearly understands the marketplace and can award a contract or order for an effective solution at a reasonable price. The Federal Government's ability to achieve successful program outcomes, effectively and efficiently, depends upon agencies establishing effective strategies for industry engagement and supporting those strategies with senior-level commitment.

                        conduct discussions and, if so, what the scope and extent of discussions required should be. Schedule pressures should generally not be the primary, or even a strong, driver in the contracting officer's decision on whether or not to hold discussions. One consideration the contracting officer should take into account is that conducting robust presolicitation communications with industry may actually minimize the need for discussions and result in a better technical solution and improved contract performance. Other considerations include the complexity of the procurement, and the history of change orders on previous or related contracts that were due to lack of a clear understanding of the requirements, and contract terms and conditions by the parties.
