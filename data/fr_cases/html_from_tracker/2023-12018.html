                <h2 id="h-7">I. Background</h2>
                <p id="p-7" data-page="37798">Section 852 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/116/public/92" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 116-92</a>) modifies <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2411" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2411(3)</a> (redesignated <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/4951" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 4951</a>) to transfer authority of the procurement technical assistance cooperative agreement (PTAC) program from the Director of the Defense Logistics Agency to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment. This final rule revises a solicitation provision and a contract clause to reflect this statutory change, change the name of the of the entities providing assistance from PTACs to APEX Accelerators, update statutory references, and update the applicable website.</p>
                <h2 id="h-8">II. Publication of This Final Rule for Public Comment Is Not Required by Statute</h2>
                <p id="p-8" data-page="37798">The statute that applies to the publication of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) is <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1707" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1707</a>, Publication of Proposed Regulations. Subsection (a)(1) of the statute requires that a procurement policy, regulation, procedure, or form (including an amendment or modification thereof) must be published for public comment if it relates to the expenditure of appropriated funds, and has either a significant effect beyond the internal operating procedures of the agency issuing the policy, regulation, procedure, or form, or has a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors. This final rule is not required to be published for public comment, because this rule merely reflects the transfer of responsibility for the PTAC program from the Director of the Defense Logistics Agency to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, changes the name of the of the entities providing assistance from PTACs to APEX Accelerators, and updates the applicable website. This final rule does not have a significant effect beyond the internal operating procedures of the Government and does not have a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors.</p>
                <h2 id="h-9">III. Applicability to Contracts at or Below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold and for Commercial Services and Commercial Products, Including Commercially Available Off-the-Shelf Items</h2>
                <p id="p-9" data-page="37798">This rule does not create any new solicitation provisions or contract clauses. This rule merely updates information provided in the contract clause at DFARS 252.205-7000, Provision of Information to Cooperative Agreement Holders, and the solicitation provision at DFARS 252.219-7000, Advancing Small Business Growth. The rule does not impact the applicability of this clause or provision.</p>
                <h2 id="h-10">IV. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563</h2>
                <p id="p-10" data-page="37798">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993.</p>
                <h2 id="h-11">V. Congressional Review Act</h2>
                <p id="p-11" data-page="37798">
                    As required by the Congressional Review Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/801" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 801-808</a>) before an interim or final rule takes effect, DoD will submit a copy of the interim or final rule with the form, Submission of Federal Rules under the Congressional Review Act, to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Comptroller General of the United States. A major rule under the Congressional Review Act cannot take effect until 60 days after it is published in the 
                    <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                    . The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has determined that this rule is not a major rule as defined by <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/804" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 804</a>.
                </p>
                <h2 id="h-12">VI. Regulatory Flexibility Act</h2>
                <p id="p-12" data-page="37798">
                    The Regulatory Flexibility Act does not apply to this rule because this final rule does not constitute a significant DFARS revision within the meaning of FAR 1.501-1, and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1707" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1707</a> does not require publication for public comment.

However, these changes to the DFARS do not impose additional information collection requirements to the paperwork burden previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under OMB Control Number 0704-0286, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), Part 205, Publicizing Contract Actions, and DFARS 252-205-7000, Provision of Information to Cooperative Agreement Holders.</p>
