                    <h2 id="h-7">I. Background</h2>
                    <p id="p-7" data-page="9731">DoD, GSA, and NASA published a proposed rule at <a href="/citation/86-FR-53923" class="fr-reference" data-reference="86 FR 53923">86 FR 53923</a> on September 29, 2021, to implement a policy that provides for accelerated payments to contractors that are small businesses and to small business subcontractors by accelerating payments to their prime contractors. This change implements section 873 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/116/public/92" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 116-92</a>). Section 873 amends <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/31/3903" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">31 U.S.C. 3903(a)</a>.</p>
                    <p id="p-8" data-page="9731">Specifically, section 873 requires agencies to establish an accelerated payment date for small business prime contractors, to the fullest extent permitted by law, with a goal of 15 days after receipt of a proper invoice, if a specific payment date is not established by contract. Section 873 also requires that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the head of an agency establish an accelerated payment date for prime contractors that subcontract with small businesses, with a goal of 15 days after receipt of a proper invoice, if&mdash;</p>
                    <p id="p-9" data-page="9731">(1) A specific payment date is not established by contract; and</p>
                    <p id="p-10" data-page="9731">(2) The contractor agrees to make accelerated payments to the subcontractor without any further consideration from, or fees charged to, the subcontractor. The final rule implements both aspects of section 873. For DoD, however, this case implements section 815 of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry NDAA for FY 2021, which amended <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2307" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2307(a)(2)(A)</a> (now found at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/3801" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 3801</a>) by striking the language &ldquo;if a specific payment date is not established by contract.&rdquo; Accordingly, this case excludes from DoD contracts the condition reflected in the language &ldquo;a specific payment date is not established by contract.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p id="p-11" data-page="9731">Four respondents submitted comments on the proposed rule.</p>
                    <h2 id="h-8">II. Discussion and Analysis</h2>
                    <p id="p-12" data-page="9731">The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council (the Councils) reviewed the public comments in the development of the final rule. A discussion of the comments and the changes made to the rule as a result of those comments are provided as follows:</p>
                    <h3 id="h-9">A. Summary of Significant Changes</h3>
                    <p id="p-13" data-page="9731">There are no significant changes from the proposed rule.</p>
                    <h3 id="h-10">B. Analysis of Public Comments</h3>
                    <p id="p-14" data-page="9731">Of the four responses received, none provided negative comments on the rule, although they suggested changes as described below. No changes resulted from the public comments.</p>
                    <p id="p-15" data-page="9731">
                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         A respondent suggested adding the following language: &ldquo;the term &ldquo;other required documentation&rdquo; shall exclude documentation that is not commercially reasonable in the circumstances, unless such documentation is required by law.&rdquo; This respondent stated that its suggested change is meant to prevent &ldquo;the occasional agency or prime contractor [from evading] acceleration of payment under the proposed rules by establishing unreasonable requirements for documentation that a small business cannot meet.&rdquo;
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-16" data-page="9731">
                        <em>Response:</em>
                         The Councils cannot accept the suggestion because it is not consistent with the statute being implemented. Section 873 of the NDAA for FY 2020 did not create or modify a definition of &ldquo;other required documentation.&rdquo; The term &ldquo;other required documentation&rdquo; and other similar variations are used in many instances in the FAR and other agency regulations. Also, such &ldquo;documentation&rdquo; may be required by the contract or law, or both. The Councils concluded that &ldquo;other required documentation&rdquo; should be sufficient; and that adding the suggested language will not make the issue any clearer.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         A respondent expressed the need for the rule to clarify the statement &ldquo;with a goal of 15 days after receipt of proper invoice, if&mdash;(1) a specific payment date is not established by contract . . .&rdquo; The respondent expressed concern that a contracting officer may insert &ldquo;any type of specific date&mdash;
                        <em>i.e.,</em>
                         30 days, 60 days or 90 days into their contracts.&rdquo; This respondent suggested to remove the term &ldquo;goal&rdquo; and make the accelerated payment &ldquo;a requirement and that there be oversight within contracts to make certain the requirement is being achieved.&rdquo;
                    </p>

                        <em>Response:</em>
                         Congress has directed DoD to &ldquo;establish an accelerated payment date with a goal of 15 days after a proper invoice for the amount due is received.&rdquo; See section II.C. of this preamble. For civilian agencies, the Councils cannot accept the suggestion because it is not consistent with the statute.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         A respondent expressed that small business contractors having to flow down the accelerated payment to their small business subcontractors would &ldquo;essentially eliminate any financial assistance by negating the benefit of the accelerated timeline.&rdquo; This respondent expressed that the flowdown requirement &ldquo;could put an undue burden onto many small business primes who do not track the size status of their subcontractors since they are not subject to the same reporting requirements of large businesses. Being required to implement a tracking system to comply with the flowdown of accelerated payments could prove to be an additional unintended expense on the small business that would once again negate the financial benefit of accelerated payment.&rdquo;

                         The Councils cannot accept the suggestions because they are not consistent with the statute being implemented. Section 873 of the NDAA for FY 2020 requires the flowdown. The statute and the final rule do not include additional reporting or recordkeeping requirements.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         A respondent expressed strong support for the rule and urged the Councils &ldquo;to include in the final rule an expansion of the provision to apply these accelerated payment requirements to large business subcontractors.&rdquo; A respondent expressed support for the rule but believed that more analysis of the financial and administrative impact of accelerating payments to large subcontractors is required. This respondent provided three examples of questions that need to be answered: (1) How will it affect contractor ERP systems and reporting? (2) What administrative costs will be incurred and what is the overall financial impact? (3) How will the requirement be integrated with existing regulations that already dictate when payments must be made to subcontractors (
                        <em>i.e.,</em>
                         FAR 52.232-16, FAR 52.216-7)?

                        implications of applying the accelerated payment requirements to large business subcontractors and flowing them down to lower tier small business subcontractors. Interest in this issue remains, but additional research is needed to properly inform the process. The Councils, in coordination with the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, will consider whether further action through a new rulemaking should be pursued to address flowdown of accelerated payments, as well as other refinements that may be necessary to ensure the policy objective of accelerating payments to small business concerns has been achieved by the changes set forth in this rule.

Discussion of the FAR Council determinations is set forth below.</p>
                    <h3 id="h-13">A. Applicability to Contracts at or Below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold</h3>

Section 1905 generally limits the applicability of new laws when agencies are making acquisitions at or below the SAT, but provides that such acquisitions will not be exempt from a provision of law under certain circumstances, including when the FAR Council makes a written determination and finding that it would not be in the best interest of the Federal Government to exempt contracts and subcontracts in amounts not greater than the SAT from the provision of law.</p>

These accelerated payments provide benefits to contractors that are small businesses, to contractors that subcontract with small businesses, and to small business subcontractors by accelerating payments to their prime contractors, without adding any reporting or recordkeeping requirements. Approximately 96 percent of Federal contracts are in amounts at or below the SAT. An exception for contracts and subcontracts at or below the SAT would exclude contracts and subcontracts intended to be covered by the law, thereby undermining the overarching public policy purpose of the law.</p>

                        The final rule expands the FAR policy regarding accelerated payments to small business contractors by: (1) providing accelerated payments to prime contractors that are small businesses; (2) establishing a goal of payment within 15 days after receipt of a proper invoice; and (3) prohibiting prime contractors from requesting any further consideration from the subcontractor in exchange for the accelerated payments. The Government expects this rule to improve cash flow and access to the Federal marketplace for small businesses, which are likely to have lower cash reserves and less access to inexpensive credit when compared to other than small businesses,

                    <p id="p-37" data-page="9733">DoD, GSA, and NASA have prepared a Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (FRFA) consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601-612</a>. The FRFA is summarized as follows:</p>
                    
                        <p id="p-38" data-page="9733">This final rule amends the FAR to provide for accelerated payments to contractors that are small businesses, and to small business subcontractors by accelerating payments to their prime contractors. Specifically, the statute requires agencies, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to establish an accelerated payment date for small business contractors, with a goal of 15 days after receipt of a proper invoice, if a specific payment date is not established by contract. For contractors that subcontract with small businesses, the statute requires agencies, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to establish an accelerated payment date, with a goal of 15 days after receipt of a proper invoice, if&mdash;</p>
                        <p id="p-39" data-page="9733">(a) A specific payment date is not established by contract; and</p>
                        <p id="p-40" data-page="9733">(b) The contractor agrees to make accelerated payments to the subcontractor without any further consideration from, or fees charged to, the subcontractor.</p>
                        <p id="p-41" data-page="9733">For DoD, however, this rule implements section 815 of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry NDAA for FY 2021, which amended <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2307" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2307(a)(2)(A)</a> (now found at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/3801" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 3801</a>) by striking the language &ldquo;if a specific payment date is not established by contract.&rdquo; Accordingly, the final rule excludes from DoD contracts the condition reflected in the language &ldquo;a specific payment date is not established by contract.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p id="p-42" data-page="9733">The objective is to implement section 873 of the NDAA for FY 2020 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/116/public/92" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 116-92</a>), which amends <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/31/3903" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">31 U.S.C. 3903(a)</a>. The rule also implements a change made by section 815 of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry NDAA for FY 2021 to <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2307" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2307(a)</a>, now found at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/3801" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 3801</a>, which requires DoD to keep the 15 days rather than allow a different specific date to be established in the contract.</p>
                        <p id="p-43" data-page="9733">There were no significant issues raised by the public comments in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis.</p>
                        <p id="p-44" data-page="9733">The final rule applies to small businesses that are prime contractors, and to small businesses that are subcontractors on Federal prime contracts. Based on data obtained from the Federal Procurement Data System, 120,907 unique entities (including 78,813 small businesses) were awarded contracts for FY 2021. There is no data source to know how many subcontracts are awarded to small businesses. With regard to the impact of the prohibition on fees or other consideration in return for accelerated payments, it is not possible to estimate how many of these small business subcontractors may have been required to provide consideration or pay fees to the prime contractor in order to receive accelerated payments.</p>
                        <p id="p-45" data-page="9733">The final rule does not include additional reporting or recordkeeping requirements. There are no available alternatives to the final rule to accomplish the desired objective of the statute.</p>
                    
                    <p id="p-46" data-page="9733">Interested parties may obtain a copy of the FRFA from the Regulatory Secretariat Division. The Regulatory Secretariat Division has submitted a copy of the FRFA to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration.</p>
