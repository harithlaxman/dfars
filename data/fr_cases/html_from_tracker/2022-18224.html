                <p id="p-9" data-page="52343">DoD made the following changes in the interim rule:</p>
                <p id="p-10" data-page="52343">1. At DFARS 225.7018-2(c), the applicability of the production phases for tantalum metals and alloys is revised to provide clarity by removing the reference to the inclusion of the reduction of tantalum chemicals such as oxides, chlorides, or potassium salts, to metal powder. A reference to the applicability of tantalum metals of any kind and alloys to the production processing steps includes the reduction or melting of any form of tantalum is also added. Additionally, the paragraph is revised to convey that the restriction includes the subsequent production steps for the reduction or melting of any form of tantalum to create tantalum metals including unwrought, powder, mill products, and alloys.</p>

                <p id="p-13" data-page="52343">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     Two respondents strongly supported the interim rule. A respondent noted that the quantity of tantalum going into the defense industry is a manageable quantity and will have a negligible impact on U.S. businesses while affording the U.S. military a protection similarly enjoyed by the People's Republic of China with respect to tantalum products that are of U.S. origin. A respondent applauded the comprehensive scope of the rule regarding tantalum production, which is necessary to shield DoD weapon systems from unreliable sources.

                    <em>Response:</em>
                     DoD acknowledges the support for the rule.

                <h4 id="h-13">a. Impact on Customers</h4>
                <p id="p-15" data-page="52343">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     A respondent commented that this rule will not be a problem. Tantalum going into the U.S. defense industry annually is a perfectly manageable quantity to make sure that Chinese material does not enter the U.S. defense industries final applications. Another respondent commented that this policy would bleed into civilian U.S. manufacturing supply chains. As a result of this rule and other non-conflict material restrictions on tantalum from Africa, there will be insufficient alternative acceptable tantalum units for the U.S. industry in the global market. The respondent further stated this will lead to a higher price, potential raw material shortfalls, and reduced profits and competitiveness for U.S. manufacturers and end products exported.
                </p>
                <p id="p-16" data-page="52343">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The rule is required to implement section 849 of the NDAA for FY 2020. It is a matter of national security to reduce U.S. dependence on the covered countries specified in <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2533c" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2533c</a>, because tantalum is an important element in the supply chain for the production of both DoD military systems and nonmilitary systems that DoD uses.
                </p>
                <h4 id="h-14">b. Impact on Manufacturers</h4>
                <p id="p-17" data-page="52343">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     A respondent stated this rule only focuses on defense applications; the amount of overall tantalum is manageable. Another respondent expects an initial period of higher pricing and supply chain impacts after which the tantalum markets will adjust. One respondent conveyed concerns that damage to competitiveness and efficiency due to the rule could lead to a relocation of manufacturing outside the United States and thereby reduce U.S. strength in critical manufacturing sectors. Members of the respondent's organization supported a retaliatory approach to China on tantalum policy, while the other half of the members believed it was counterproductive, as it would negatively impact U.S. civilian-use manufacturers and exporters.
                </p>
                <p id="p-18" data-page="52343">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     DoD acknowledges the respondent's concern with initial impacts to U.S. manufacturers. The implementation of this prohibition is expected to decrease DoD's dependence on covered materials that originate in covered countries as a matter of national security. Tantalum is an important element in the supply chain for the production of both U.S. military systems and nonmilitary systems that DoD uses.

                <h4 id="h-15">3. Metals Trade Industry</h4>
                <p id="p-19" data-page="52343">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     A respondent stated that they did not see the interim rule affecting the metals trade and metals industry generally, either domestically or internationally. The respondent further stated the price of tantalum will not increase since the amount of tantalum in question is minimal annually. Accordingly, the orders placed would separate defense and commercial consumer applications, will be balanced, and will not negatively impact consumers financially. The respondent also stated that U.S. companies are not allowed to sell tantalum to China and this interim rule is exactly the same.
                </p>
                <p id="p-20" data-page="52343">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     DoD acknowledges the respondent's position and agrees that the impact of the rule on the metals industry will have minor impacts both domestically and internationally.
                </p>

                <p id="p-21" data-page="52343">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     A respondent discussed the overall impact of the interim rule on broader international trade and a

                    potential U.S.-wide restriction on the acquisition of tantalum in the future, from the designated regions or a potential change to consumer purchasing policy. The respondent also stated the importance of ensuring the scope of the rule remained only for tantalum for defense applications, since the defense tantalum market is small and manageable, and it should not be expanded further since U.S. companies do sell tantalum finished products to Chinese customers. The respondent further stated that China does not allow tantalum of U.S. origin.

                <p id="p-22" data-page="52344">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The defense industry consumption of tantalum units is a small portion of the tantalum market with regard to global consumption. This rule is not going to impact the tantalum market as a whole.

                <h4 id="h-18">b. Potential Price Increases for Tantalum in the U.S. Supply Chain</h4>
                <p id="p-23" data-page="52344">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     Several respondents discussed the impact on broader international trade as a result of the more restrictive implementation of the statute with regard to the criteria for the exception applicability to the entire end item versus the covered material within the end item. These respondents further stated the interim rule will have negative impacts to international trade, increased administrative burden on industry, and increased costs to the Government. A respondent stated that tantalum prices from non-covered countries have increased and may continue to do so. The respondent further stated the interim rule's applicability to DoD products may increase costs due to manufacturer's dual use of tantalum in the commercial and defense industries and the subsequent requirement for segregation of products to track the defense products in accordance with the statutory requirements.
                </p>
                <p id="p-24" data-page="52344">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The rule implements section 849 of the NDAA for FY 2020. Since the defense tantalum market is a small portion of the overall global market, DoD anticipates minimal impacts to international trade and minimal increased administrative burden on industry.

                <h4 id="h-20">a. Entire End Item and Electronic Device</h4>
                <p id="p-25" data-page="52344">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     A few respondents argued that the interim rule incorrectly applied an exception to the prohibition on procurement of covered materials found at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2533c" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2533c(c)(3)</a>. The interim rule provides an exception for end items that are also an electronic device. The respondents argued that this misapplies the statute, narrows the exception beyond what the statute intended, and makes part of the language of the statute superfluous.
                </p>
                <p id="p-26" data-page="52344">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     DoD does agree that the omission of &ldquo;containing a covered material&rdquo; changes the underlying intent or application of the rule. Of note, the restriction in <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2533c" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2533c</a> is modeled on the domestic preference in <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2533b" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2533b</a>, with similar exceptions related to commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) items and electronic components and devices. Based on the similar construction of these statutes, DoD interprets the exception for &ldquo;electronic devices&rdquo; pursuant to DFARS 225.7018-3 to include components embedded in other end items. For example, a missile or munition purchased by DoD may contain tantalum units in a capacitor. The same missile or munition may contain tantalum or tungsten units in an explosively-formed penetrator. The tantalum units embedded in the capacitor would be covered by the &ldquo;electronic devices&rdquo; exception, but the tantalum or tungsten units in the explosively-formed penetrator would not be covered by the exception. DoD believes that the application of the exception provided in this example aligns with congressional intent, providing an exception for those products with significant commercial market exposure (
                    <em>e.g.,</em>
                     a capacitor) while maintaining coverage for military-unique products (
                    <em>e.g.,</em>
                     an explosively-formed penetrator). DoD further addresses the respondents' feedback on these specific aspects of the rule in the category of comments at paragraph 8c, entitled clarification of the rule.

                <h4 id="h-21">b. Prior Melting Production of Tantalum Raw Materials</h4>
                <p id="p-27" data-page="52344">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     A respondent asked that the interim rule be amended to clarify that the prohibition on procuring any covered material melted or produced in any covered country applies only to the melting or production of tantalum metals and alloys that immediately precedes delivery to the DoD customer or a supplier's higher-tier contractor customer. Two respondents stated that because tantalum may be melted or produced or re-melted or reproduced multiple times in the supply chain life cycle, the only rational reading of <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2533c" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2533c</a> is to conclude that the most recent melting or manufacture of the covered material prior to transfer to DoD or to a higher-tier contractor customer does not occur in a covered country. In addition, another respondent further stated the interim rule did not contain the phrase &ldquo;and melting&rdquo; with regard to the prohibition of the production of tantalum metal and alloys, including the reduction of tantalum chemicals such as oxides, chlorides, or potassium salts, to metal powder and all subsequent phases of the production of tantalum metal and alloys, such as consolidation of metal powders and melting. The respondent requested the rationale for the omission of &ldquo;and melting&rdquo; in the implementation of section 849 of the NDAA for FY 2020 in the interim rule.
                </p>
                <p id="p-28" data-page="52344">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     DoD acknowledges that at the time the interim rule was issued, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2533c" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2533c</a> was meant to apply to melting or manufacture of the covered material. However, section 844 of the NDAA for FY 2021 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/116/public/283" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 116-283</a>) passed subsequent to the publication of the interim rule. In section 844, Congress amended <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2533c" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2533c(a)</a>(1) from &ldquo;. . . procuring any covered material melted or produced in any covered nation. . .&rdquo; to &ldquo;. . . procuring any covered material mined, refined, separated, melted or produced in any covered nation. . .&rdquo;. The current rulemaking effort applies only to the changes mandated by section 849 of the NDAA for FY 2020. Section 844 of the NDAA for FY 2021 has an effective date five years after the date of enactment and will be implemented via future rulemaking under DFARS Case 2021-D015. DoD has deleted the reference to &ldquo;chemicals such as oxides, chlorides, or potassium salts, to metal powder&rdquo; and simplified the language to include &ldquo;reduction or melting of any form&rdquo;. DoD has also clarified the final forms of tantalum metals as &ldquo;including unwrought, powder, mill products, and alloys.&rdquo;

                     A respondent requested that the draft rule be revised to exclude tantalum powder from the definition of &ldquo;covered material.&rdquo; The respondent argued that Congress did not intend to place restrictions on tantalum powder as neither <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2533c" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2533c</a> nor section 849 of the NDAA for FY 2020 mention tantalum powder specifically, but rather refer to &ldquo;tantalum metals and alloys.&rdquo;

                     DoD concurs that the statute at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2533c" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2533c</a> on its face does not include tantalum powder as a covered material. The final rule clarifies that tantalum powder is included in the rule to further explain that tantalum powder is also considered a metal and therefore, tantalum powder also would be restricted. In addition, the rule applies the restriction to cover all subsequent phases of production of tantalum metals and alloys.

                     A respondent noted that tantalum is a key component of capacitors used in military and commercial applications, and that the United States is dependent on foreign countries, including China, to acquire tantalum and tantalum capacitors. Therefore, any implementation of supply constraints should be considered judiciously to guarantee the availability of tantalum capacitors for U.S. applications.

                     DoD is aware of U.S. dependence on foreign countries to acquire tantalum and tantalum capacitors for military and commercial use. DoD continues to work with allied nations to strengthen this part of the foreign supply chain for strategic and critical materials such as tantalum. Additionally, DoD has mandated programs in place to strengthen the industrial base by funding projects to increase domestic capability to produce products, including strategic and critical materials such as tantalum, for military use.

DFARS 252.225-7052(b)(1) identifies that the restrictions listed apply to the contractor, who &ldquo;shall not deliver under this contract any covered material melted or produced in any covered country, or any end item, manufactured in any covered country, that contains a covered material (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2533c" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2533c</a>).&rdquo; Moreover, DFARS 252.225-7052(d) directs the contractor to insert the substance of the clause, including paragraph (d), in subcontracts and other contractual instruments that are for items containing a covered material, including subcontracts and other contractual instruments for commercial products and commercial services, unless an exception in paragraph (c) of this clause applies. Therefore, DFARS clause 252.225-7052 does apply restrictions and exceptions to both contractors and subcontractors.

                     A respondent recommended a one-time waiver to address material on hand and in process including alloy already processed. The respondent further stated that manufacturers normally procure tantalum one year in advance for forecasted usage and may purchase multiple years of supply at that time that may contain tantalum from covered countries. The respondent further stated that if the Government does not permit manufacturers to use in-process tantalum from covered countries for military products, the costs to the Government will likely rise in order to compensate manufacturers for the noncompliant tantalum procured prior to the implementation of the prohibition.

                     The interim rule was published on September 29, 2020, implementing section 849 of the NDAA for FY 2020. Implementation of this prohibition was urgent, because decreasing DoD's dependence on covered materials that originate in covered countries is a matter of national security. Tantalum is an important element in the supply chain for production of both U.S. military systems and nonmilitary systems that DoD uses. A shortage of supply of these covered materials would therefore hinder maintenance and replacement of many DoD military systems and would also have a negative impact on the broader industrial base upon which DoD depends. Section 849 of the NDAA for FY 2020 mandates compliance with this prohibition as implemented in the interim rule published on September 29, 2020, and in effect on October 1, 2020. In addition, FAR and DFARS changes apply to solicitations issued on or after the effective date of the change unless otherwise specified (see FAR 1.108(d)).

Although <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2533c" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2533c</a> provides that the exception to the restriction on tungsten for COTS items does not apply to a COTS item that is 50 percent or more tungsten by weight, section 849 does not add a similar condition with regard to tantalum metal and alloys.</p>

L. 116-92</a>) (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2533c" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2533c</a>). The objective of the rule is to implement the section 849 prohibition on the acquisition of tantalum metals and alloys from North Korea, China, Russia, or Iran.</p>
                <p id="p-60" data-page="52347">There were no significant issues raised by the public comments in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis.</p>
                <p id="p-61" data-page="52347">This rule will apply to an annual average of approximately 697 small entities. Based on data from the Federal Procurement Data System for FY 2019, FY 2020, and FY 2021, DoD awarded in the United States 13,204 contracts that exceeded the simplified acquisition threshold of $250,000 and were for the acquisition of manufactured end products (excluding those categories that could not include tantalum such as clothing and fabrics, books, or lumber products). These contracts were awarded to 3,447 unique entities, of which 2,090 were small entities. It is not known what percentage of these awards involved tantalum, or what lesser percentage might involve tantalum from China, North Korea, Russia, or Iran.</p>
                <p id="p-62" data-page="52347">There are no projected reporting or recordkeeping requirements. However, there may be compliance costs to track the origin of covered materials.</p>
                <p id="p-63" data-page="52347">DoD is exempting acquisitions equal to or less than the simplified acquisition threshold. DoD was unable to identify any other alternatives that would reduce burden on small businesses and still meet the objectives of the statute.</p>
