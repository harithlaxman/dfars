                <p id="p-6" data-page="14862">On April 2, 2014, DoD, GSA, and NASA proposed to amend the FAR to implement a recommendation made by DoD pursuant to section 829 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (<a href="/citation/79-FR-18503" class="fr-reference" data-reference="79 FR 18503">79 FR 18503</a>). The proposed rule considered extending the limitations at FAR subpart 3.11 on contractor employee personal conflicts of interest to individuals performing any function that is closely associated with inherently governmental functions and certain individuals performing contracts for personal services.</p>

                    A decision was made not to proceed with finalization of the proposed rule. Because of the passage of time since the proposed rule was issued in 2014, and the fact that section 829 did not require any changes to the FAR, the FAR Council believes further consideration of any amendments to the FAR related

                    to limitations on contractor employee personal conflicts of interest should be accomplished under a new FAR case. Accordingly, the proposed rule published at <a href="/citation/79-FR-18503" class="fr-reference" data-reference="79 FR 18503">79 FR 18503</a> on April 2, 2014, is withdrawn and FAR Case 2013-022 is closed.
