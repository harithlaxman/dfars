                <h2 id="h-11">VI. Regulatory Flexibility Act</h2>
                <p id="p-12" data-page="25186">
                    DoD does not expect this final rule to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>, 
                    <em>et seq.</em>
                     However, a final regulatory flexibility analysis has been performed and is summarized as follows:
                </p>
                <p id="p-13" data-page="25186">DoD is amending the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) to implement section 821 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2018. Section 821 amends <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1908" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1908(d)</a> by including a statement that the inflation adjusted acquisition-related dollar thresholds apply to existing contracts and subcontracts in effect on the date of the adjustment.</p>
                <p id="p-14" data-page="25186">There were no comments made by the public in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis.</p>
                <p id="p-15" data-page="25186">This rule will likely affect, to some extent, all small business concerns that submit offers or are awarded contracts by the Federal Government. For Fiscal Year 2017, there were 106,438 unique vendors in the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) identified as small business concerns.</p>
                <p id="p-16" data-page="25186">This rule is not expected to have any significant economic impact on small business concerns, because this rule: (1) Is not creating any new requirements with which small entities must comply, and (2) is only establishing the framework to apply the inflation adjustments of statutory acquisition-related thresholds under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1908" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1908</a> to existing contracts and subcontracts in effect on the date of the adjustment. The rule will have minimal impact on small businesses when responding to solicitations where an inflation-adjusted threshold applies. Any impacts of this rule will have a positive impact on small business entities.</p>
                <p id="p-17" data-page="25186">The next inflation adjustment to the thresholds will be implemented through a future DFARS rule. The inflation adjustments are intended to maintain the status quo by adjusting for changes in the value of the dollar. Often any impact on small business concerns will be beneficial by preventing burdensome requirements from applying to small dollar value acquisitions, which are the acquisitions for which small business concerns are most likely to participate.</p>
                <p id="p-18" data-page="25186">The rule does not duplicate, overlap, or conflict with any other Federal rules.</p>
                <p id="p-19" data-page="25186">There are no known significant alternative approaches to the proposed rule that would meet the requirements of the applicable statute.</p>
                <h2 id="h-12">VI. Paperwork Reduction Act</h2>
                <p id="p-20" data-page="25186">The rule does not contain any information collection requirements that require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/44/3501" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44 U.S.C. chapter 35</a>).</p>
