                <p id="p-6" data-page="31656">
                    DoD published a proposed rule in the 
                    <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                     at <a href="/citation/88-FR-67611" class="fr-reference" data-reference="88 FR 67611">88 FR 67611</a> on September 29, 2023, to implement section 808 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/117/public/263" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 117-263</a>). Section 808 amends section 818 of <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/109/public/364" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Public Law 109-364</a> to limit the number of low-rate initial production lots associated with a major defense acquisition program to be procured to no more than one when the milestone decision authority authorizes the use of a fixed-price type contract at Milestone B and the scope of the work includes both development and low-rate initial production. This limitation may be waived. Two respondents submitted public comments in response to the proposed rule.

                <p id="p-8" data-page="31656">There are no significant changes from the proposed rule.</p>

                <p id="p-9" data-page="31656">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     One respondent indicted support for the rule.
                </p>
                <p id="p-10" data-page="31656">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The support for the rule is noted.

                <h4 id="h-12">2. Clarifications</h4>
                <p id="p-11" data-page="31656">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     One respondent suggested that the rule should define or provide a reference to the definition of a fixed-price contract. The rule does not specify whether fixed-price contracts include firm-fixed-price, fixed-price-incentive, or fixed-price-with-economic-price-adjustment, which could create ambiguity or inconsistency in the application of the rule and affect the level of risk and incentive for the Government and contractors. The respondent recommended providing a reference to the relevant section of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) that defines these types of contracts or specify the types of fixed-price contracts that can be used.
                </p>
                <p id="p-12" data-page="31656">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     This rule does not stand alone; contracting officers will implement the rule in the context provided by the FAR and DFARS. FAR subpart 16.2 describes the types of fixed-price contracts that a contracting officer may use. The DFARS, as a supplement to the FAR, does not duplicate the content of the FAR.
                </p>
                <p id="p-13" data-page="31656">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     One respondent suggested that the rule should explain the rationale or purpose of the limitation on procuring more than one lot for low-rate initial production (LRIP) using a fixed-price type contract for a major defense acquisition program. The rule currently does not state why this limitation is necessary or beneficial, or how it relates to the objective of reducing cost risk and improving performance. This could make it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness or impact of the rule, or to justify its use in specific cases.
                </p>
                <p id="p-14" data-page="31656">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     Section 808 of the NDAA for FY 2023 limits the number of LRIP lots to no more than one on fixed-price contracts that also include development. Neither section 808 nor the Joint Explanatory Statement provides the rationale or purpose of the limitation. However, the limitation may result in a reduction in risk to the contractor associated with proposing prices for multiple production lots of an item prior to the completion of development and initial production of the item.
                </p>
                <p id="p-15" data-page="31656">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     One respondent suggested that the rule should establish some criteria or guidelines for exercising the waiver authority for the limitation on LRIP procurement. The rule currently does not indicate how the service acquisition executive should decide whether to grant or deny a waiver, or what factors should be considered in making this decision. This could lead to arbitrary or inconsistent decisions or undermine the accountability or transparency of the waiver process. Providing examples of factors that could justify a waiver and indicate that the waiver authority should be used sparingly and only in exceptional circumstances.
                </p>
                <p id="p-16" data-page="31656">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     Section 808 provides the service acquisition executive the authority to waive this limitation. It does not specify the criteria to be considered in making such a waiver decision. Providing examples of factors to consider in determining whether or not to waive the limitation may preclude the consideration of factors that are relevant to the instant acquisition and may have a negative impact on meeting mission needs.

                <p id="p-17" data-page="31656">This final rule does not create any new solicitation provisions or contract clauses. It does not impact any existing solicitation provisions or contract clauses or their applicability to contracts valued at or below the simplified acquisition threshold, for commercial products including COTS items, or for commercial services.</p>
                <h2 id="h-14">IV. Expected Impact of the Rule</h2>
                <p id="p-18" data-page="31656">
                    As a result of this final rule, unless waived, the Government may not procure more than one low-rate initial production lot associated with a major defense acquisition program if, at the time of Milestone B approval, the milestone decision authority authorizes the use of a fixed-price type contract and the scope of work of the fixed-price contract includes both development and low-rate initial production of items associated with such major defense acquisition program. This rule does not impact contractor operations; however, it may limit contractor risk assumed under such contracts. Development and initial production of an item likely involve the discovery and resolution of problems that are unknown beforehand. Risk to a contractor is higher when the contractor must propose prices for multiple production lots of an item before the development and initial production of that item are complete. By limiting the number of low-rate initial production lots on a fixed-price contract

                    that also includes development, this risk to the contractor may be reduced.

A major rule under the Congressional Review Act cannot take effect until 60 days after it is published in the

                    <em>et seq.</em>

                </p>
                <p id="p-22" data-page="31657">This final rule is necessary to implement section 808 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/117/public/263" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub.

                <p id="p-23" data-page="31657">No comments were received in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis.</p>
                <p id="p-24" data-page="31657">Data is not available on the number of fixed-price type contracts for major defense acquisition programs that contain both development and low-rate initial production; therefore, data was obtained for contracts that include DFARS clause 252.234-7004, Cost and Software Data Reporting System, or its alternate I clause. This DFARS clause is required to be included in solicitations and contracts for major defense acquisition programs that exceed $50 million, and its alternate I clause is required to be included in solicitations and contracts for major defense acquisition programs that are greater than $20 million but less than or equal to $50 million under certain circumstances. According to the Procurement Business Intelligence Service, DoD awarded contracts for major defense acquisition programs to 130 unique small entities in FY 2021, 99 in FY 2022, and 109 in FY 2023. The average over the three-year period is 112 per fiscal year. Therefore, the number of small entities to which this rule may apply is 112.</p>
