                <h2 id="h-7">A. Background</h2>
                <p id="p-6" data-page="48276">The proposed rule addressed DFARS subpart 217.74, which prescribes policies and procedures for the management and oversight of undefinitized contract actions (UCAs). In the current DFARS, unpriced change orders that are issued in accordance with FAR part 43 and DFARS part 243 are excluded from the scope of subpart 217.74. A rule was proposed because of the need for full accountability and enhanced oversight of unpriced contractual actions, including unpriced change orders.</p>
                <p id="p-7" data-page="48276">
                    The proposed rule was published in the 
                    <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                     at <a href="/citation/74-FR-37669" class="fr-reference" data-reference="74 FR 37669">74 FR 37669</a> on July 29, 2009. Two respondents submitted comments in response to the proposed rule. One respondent deemed this &ldquo;a new rule that is very much needed,&rdquo; while the other respondent requested that the proposed rule be withdrawn. To enhance transparency and accountability, DoD has determined to proceed with this rule. The comments submitted by the respondents are addressed in the following paragraphs.
                </p>

                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     Make a separate limitation on obligations applicable to small businesses.

                <p id="p-9" data-page="48276">
                    One respondent addressed the percentage limitation on obligations prior to definitization, which the proposed rule, at DFARS 243.204-70-4(a), set at 50 percent. There is an exception in the proposed rule allowing an increase from 50 percent to 75 percent when a contractor submits a qualifying proposal before 50 percent of the not-to-exceed price has been obligated by the Government. The respondent recommended that the latter percentage be increased from 75 percent to 95 percent for small, small disadvantaged, and HUBZone businesses. In support of its position, the respondent cited frequent instances where it believed that a particular agency had requested multiple audits as a delaying tactic to avoid definitization. When definitization is delayed, the contractor can perform up to half of the work that has been required unilaterally by the Government without being

                    reimbursed. According to the respondent, this burden would impact small and small disadvantaged businesses disproportionately, because they do not have the internal cash flow generally available to large businesses.

                <p id="p-10" data-page="48277">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     This is an issue of faulty execution on the part of the agency cited, not a problem with the policy. Enabling an unpriced contract action to continue in an unpriced state up to 95 percent of the not-to-exceed price, would only place contractors at greater risk and give contracting officers even less incentive to definitize the action in a timely manner.
                </p>
                <p id="p-11" data-page="48277">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     Limiting a contractor's profit for reduced risk doesn't consider that the contractor's risk is increased while a contract obligation is undefinitized.
                </p>
                <p id="p-12" data-page="48277">The new section 243.204-70-6 (Allowable profit) requires the Government to consider &ldquo;(a) Any reduced cost risk to the contractor&rdquo; when a substantial portion of the required performance has been completed before the contract action is definitized. Both respondents objected to the regulation's assumption that a contractor's cost risk declines in this situation. One respondent stated that it would be grossly unfair for DoD to retain the uniquely Government right to issue unilateral change orders and then penalize contractors by decrementing allowable profit on incurred costs. The other respondent claimed that the contractor experiences increased, not decreased, cost risk during the period that the change order remains undefinitized.</p>
                <p id="p-13" data-page="48277">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The respondents have not acknowledged that the Government also incurs increased cost risk during the period prior to definitization of the contract action. The intent of this coverage is to (1) increase transparency; (2) provide management oversight to prevent abuses in the definitization process; and (3) provide incentives for both the Government and contractors to definitize UCAs as quickly as reasonably possible. Therefore, this portion of the proposed rule will not be changed because doing so would reduce a big incentive to definitize an action in the minimum reasonable time. Further, the 50 percent and 75 percent limitations are established by statute (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2326" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2326(b)(3)</a>), and DoD does not have authority to modify them.

                <p id="p-14" data-page="48277">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     Foreign military sales, special access programs, congressionally mandated long-lead procurement contracts, and purchases under the simplified acquisition threshold are exempted from the definition of undefinitized contract action (UCA).
                </p>
                <p id="p-15" data-page="48277">One respondent cites <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2326" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2326</a> as exempting the above categories from the definition of UCA. Therefore, according to the respondent, DoD is prohibited from including these types of change orders in the UCA definition.</p>
                <p id="p-16" data-page="48277">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The Congress recently took a different position on this issue. It is a matter of statutory construction that later-enacted laws take precedence over prior-enacted laws. This rule of statutory construction is particularly relevant here. In this case, section 812 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/111/public/84" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 111-84</a>), enacted October 28, 2009, requires DoD to extend the limitations on cost reimbursement and profit/fee to all categories of undefinitized contract actions.

                <p id="p-17" data-page="48277">This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">Executive Order 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993.

                     because the change is to internal Government operating procedures. The rule makes requirements for DoD management and oversight of unpriced change orders consistent with those that apply to other undefinitized contract actions.
