                        DoD, GSA, and NASA published a proposed rule in the 
                        <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                         at <a href="/citation/76-FR-37704" class="fr-reference" data-reference="76 FR 37704">76 FR 37704</a> on June 28, 2011, under FAR Case 2009-042, to implement recommendations from Government Accountability Office (GAO) Report GAO-09-374, entitled &ldquo;Better Performance Information Needed to Support Agency Contract Award Decisions,&rdquo; and Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) memorandum entitled &ldquo;Improving the Use of Contractor Performance Information&rdquo; (dated July 29, 2009). Two amendments to the proposed rule were published in the 
                        <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                         at <a href="/citation/76-FR-48776" class="fr-reference" data-reference="76 FR 48776">76 FR 48776</a> on August 9, 2011, and at <a href="/citation/76-FR-50714" class="fr-reference" data-reference="76 FR 50714">76 FR 50714</a> on August 16, 2011. Twenty three respondents submitted comments on the proposed rule. A second proposed rule that was published in the 
                        <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                         at <a href="/citation/77-FR-54864" class="fr-reference" data-reference="77 FR 54864">77 FR 54864</a> on September 6, 2012, addressed all comments received in response to the first proposed rule and, in addition, proposed to implement paragraphs (a), (b), and (d) of section 806 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/112/public/81" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 112-81</a>). The second proposed rule further requested comments on the merits of modifying the FAR requirements governing the appeal process to evaluate if this would improve or weaken the effectiveness of past performance policies and associated principles of impartiality and accountability. Seventeen respondents submitted comments on the second proposed rule. This rule also incorporates agency management accountability requirements from section 853 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/112/public/239" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub.

It was noted that the FAR 43.1503(b)(2)(vi) examples should be deleted because they are inflammatory negative examples, they duplicated Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), and they were examples of performance findings rather than other areas of evaluation.

                         The &ldquo;other&rdquo; evaluation factor was added to capture events that may have a bearing on contractor performance that do not fit well within any of the other five categories. The examples listed are just some of the factors that the contracting officer may consider, and they in no way preclude the inclusion of positive information regarding the contractor's performance. Evaluations include negative and positive information about the contractor's performance to inform the contractor of the Government's concerns so improvements can be made to achieve the intended results under the contract. The &ldquo;Other&rdquo; evaluation factor allows flexibility for contracting officers to consider factors unique to each contract.

                         The requirement for cost control is not new to contractor performance information; it is included in FAR 42.1501 and listed as an example to consider when reviewing relevant information. Cost control is not the only factor that is considered relevant past performance information, but it is relevant information for source selection officials to consider especially under cost contracts. Other factors such as technical, schedule/timeliness, and management or business relations are some of the relevant considerations reported in past performance evaluations, and that also will be used to evaluate a contractor's overall performance.

                         By adding the CPARS rating factors, uniform definitions are established and standardized for evaluation ratings. However, there is flexibility to tailor evaluation ratings to the contract type, size, content, and complexity of the contractual requirements.

                         One respondent commented on linking past performance in FAR 42.1503(d) to future responsibility determinations in FAR subpart 9.1 and the impact of a contractor with more than one contract to have a negative performance evaluation on one contract take precedence over good or excellent performance on many other contracts in future responsibility determinations.

                         Contracting officers are required to use sound judgment in determining the weight and relevance of all information in relation to the present acquisition. FAR 15.305(a)(1)(i) on use of past performance information in source selection states that the comparative assessment of past performance is separate from the responsibility determination required under FAR subpart 9.1.

                         The respondent's company was unfairly evaluated in multiple 100 percent 8(a) set-aside solicitations because an agency procurement office blocked the contracting officer technical representatives from putting their past performance evaluations in the CPARS and PPIRS, according to the respondent.

                         FAR 42.1503(d) does allow contractors to submit comments, rebutting statements, or additional information. If there is a disagreement between the parties, the contractor can request a review of the evaluation at a level above the contracting officer. The ultimate conclusion on the performance evaluation is a decision of the contracting agency.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         The FAR currently requires agencies to provide for review of agency evaluations at a level above the contracting officer to consider disagreements between the parties regarding the evaluation. In accordance with the FAR Council's Retrospective Plan and Analysis of Existing Rules, this requirement, at FAR 42.1503(b), was singled out in the second proposed rule with a request for comments on whether modifying the appeal process would improve or weaken the effectiveness of past performance policies and associated principles of impartiality and accountability. There were seven responses to this request; all urged that the appeals process be retained.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-55" data-page="46785">The respondents considered that elimination of the appeals process would reduce contractor competition, increase the likelihood of disruptive and costly litigation, weaken the effectiveness of past performance review procedures, and undermine confidence in the process. One respondent noted that, even when the appeals process was not used, it acted as an important due-process protection for contractors. The availability of the appeals process, according to respondents, ensures that individual Government rater bias or lack of understanding of the complete program, not just contracting issues, can be brought out and addressed.</p>

                        evaluations contained errors that, upon appeal, resulted in substantive changes in the final performance ratings and/or narratives. Another respondent stressed that the past performance appeals process benefits not just contractors, but the Government, in that it ensures more accurate information is available for source selection decisions.

                         The process for appealing an initial past performance evaluation remains in FAR 42.1503 to allow the contractor the ability to comment on the evaluation and agencies the opportunity to consider the contractor's rebuttal statement and material, and, if appropriate, revise the evaluation to reflect any agreed upon changes. However, it should be noted that the existence of an appeal need not delay making a past performance evaluation available to source selection officials.

                         These phrases allow the exceptional or very good contractor to be rewarded for exceeding Government requirements. This benefits the contractor not only in regard to the current requirement, but also future requirements that it may be considered for.

                         The exceptional rating allows the Government to recognize performance that goes well beyond the norm, and the marginal rating allows the Government to identify a contractor that has serious performance issues, but that is still trying to perform to the Government requirement. The respondent's second comment is noted. The Governmentwide CPARS Guide was released in November 2012 with the existing five ratings (exceptional, very good, satisfactory, marginal, and unsatisfactory) that were considered necessary to address various levels of performance. It includes the description of each rating, and the rating assigned the contractor should correspond to the performance requirements stated in the contract or order (

                         Several respondents requested that the Councils exempt research and development contracts, or the subset of science and technology contracts, from past performance assessments. One respondent asked to limit the requirement to actions exceeding $10 million dollars. Two respondents pointed out that the CPARS guidance excludes certain science and technology contracts. Two respondents stated that many of the mandatory evaluation factors are not relevant to science and technology contracts.

                        research and development contracts from past performance assessments, at any dollar value, because doing so would not allow the Government to obtain information about the contractor's performance. There are past performance evaluations of science and technology contracts in CPARS now. The requirement at FAR 42.1503(b)(1) to &ldquo;include a clear, non-technical description of the principal purpose of the contract or order&rdquo; was added specifically for science and technology contracts.

                         One respondent recommended increased clarity for FAR 42.1503(d) because the paragraph could be read to allow release of past performance information to third parties once the periods in FAR 42.1503(g) have expired. The respondent recommended that past performance evaluations be made public after source selection. A respondent asked that the rule clarify that the past performance information would not be publicly displayed.

                         The purpose of this case is to provide Governmentwide standardized past performance evaluation factors and performance rating categories and require that past performance information be entered into the CPARS. The proposed rule did not propose any changes to the FAR with regard to public release of past performance evaluations. Therefore, any such changes in the final rule would be outside the scope of this case.

                         One respondent stated that the proposed rule creates a double standard and allows personal judgment by the evaluator. The respondent recommended a definition of what qualifies a contract to be assessed under more scrutiny and a new table for contracts that fit the definition be added to the FAR.

                         An additional definition and new table are not necessary. The tables added are existing tables that reside in CPARS and have been used by various Federal acquisition personnel since the system was established. These tables and definitions are being transferred into the FAR to standardize and regulate the ratings and evaluation factors across the Federal Government.

                         As a matter of policy, CPARS was implemented Governmentwide on October 1, 2010. There was no migration of the past performance reviews to CPARS. If a review was in process, it would have been completed in the review system an agency was using before October 1, 2010.
