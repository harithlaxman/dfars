                    <p id="p-13" data-page="46900">
                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         The respondent expressed support for the rule and the determination that it is in the best interest of the Government to apply the new DFARS clause to contracts and subcontracts for commercial items, including commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) items. The respondent further stated that excluding the new rule from application to contracts and subcontracts for commercial items would create a loophole that would undermine the overarching intent of the statute and purpose of the rule to restrict the purchase of large medium-speed diesel engines for auxiliary ships, unless the engines are manufactured in the national technology and industrial base.

                    <h4 id="h-12">2. Clarifying Definition for &ldquo;Large Medium-Speed Diesel Engines&rdquo;</h4>
                    <p id="p-15" data-page="46900">
                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         The respondent recommended revising the definition for large medium-speed diesel engines with the addition of the following for clarity: A &ldquo;medium-speed diesel engine&rdquo; operates between 400 and 1200 rotations per minute (RPM). &ldquo;Large&rdquo; refers to the brake horsepower (bHP) delivered starting at a minimum of 5,000 bHP (~3.75 MW).
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-16" data-page="46900">
                        <em>Response:</em>
                         DoD concurs with the need for clarity concerning the definition of &ldquo;large medium-speed diesel engine&rdquo;. Accordingly, large medium-speed diesel engines are defined as diesel engines whose revolutions per minute (RPM) fall between 300 and 1500 RPM with a displacement greater than 1500 cubic inches per cylinder. DoD considers medium-speed diesel engines to fall within the range of 300 to 1500 RPMs based on purchasing experience and market research. Regarding the definition of &ldquo;large&rdquo;, DoD considers displacement, 
                        <em>i.e.,</em>
                         how much volume can be pumped through the engine, as the appropriate factor for engine size as opposed to brake horsepower that measures the power of the engine. Based on this analysis, DoD determines that large marine diesel engines have a displacement of 1500 cubic inches per cylinder or more.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-17" data-page="46900">The following new definition for large medium-speed diesel engines is added at DFARS 225.7001, Definitions, and to the clause at 252.225-7062: &ldquo;Large medium-speed diesel engines means diesel engines whose revolutions per minute (RPM) fall between 300 and 1500 RPM with a displacement greater than 1500 cubic inches per cylinder.&rdquo;</p>
                    <h4 id="h-13">3. Recommended Clarification to DFARS 212.504(a)</h4>
                    <p id="p-18" data-page="46900">
                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         The respondent recommended a minor clarifying revision to DFARS 212.504(a) to reflect the determination that the proposed new clause at DFARS 252.225-70XX should apply to commercial item subcontracts. The respondent stated that currently, DFARS 212.504(a) lists 
                        <span class="printed-page-inline unprinted-element document-markup" data-page="46901">

                        statutory provisions that are not applicable to subcontracts at any tier for the acquisition of commercial items or commercial components. The respondent further stated that currently included in that list of statutory provisions at DFARS 212.504(a), is <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2534" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2534</a>, the statute that implements section 853. While the proposed rule stated the intent to apply the new DFARS 252.225-70XX clause to commercial item subcontracts at all tiers, leaving DFARS 212.504(a) as currently drafted may create confusion as to whether subcontracts for commercial item large medium-speed diesel engines are subject to the restriction imposed by the rule.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-19" data-page="46901">The respondent recommended a conforming edit to DFARS 212.504(a) to apply the new restriction imposed by <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2534" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2534</a> for large medium-speed diesel engines to commercial item subcontracts. The respondent further recommended additional revisions to remove 10 U.S.C. 2534 from its listing under DFARS 212.504(a) and add as a new listing under DFARS 212.504(b).</p>

                        <em>Response:</em>
                         DoD acknowledges the omission and concurs with revising DFARS 212.504(a) to clarify the application of the new restriction imposed by <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/4864" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 4864</a> to commercial product, commercial service, and commercial component subcontracts that exceed the SAT, and therefore include an additional reference at 212.504(b)(iii). Related conforming changes are also made to DFARS 212.503. Accordingly, DoD has revised the following:

                    <p id="p-24" data-page="46901">This rule creates a new DFARS clause, 252.225-7062, Restriction on Acquisition of Large Medium-Speed Diesel Engines. Section 853 amends <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/4864" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 4864(a)</a> to provide a limitation on components for auxiliary ships. <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/4864" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 4864</a> does not apply to a contract or subcontract for an amount that does not exceed the SAT (see paragraph (g)).

                    <p id="p-29" data-page="46901">Section 853 of the NDAA for FY 2020 does not apply to contracts at or below the SAT and is silent on applicability to contracts and subcontracts for the acquisition of commercial products and commercial services. Also, the statute does not provide for civil or criminal penalties. Therefore, it does not apply to contracts or subcontracts for the acquisition of commercial products and commercial services unless a written determination is made. Due to delegations of authority, the Principal Director, Defense Pricing and Contracting is the appropriate authority to make this determination.</p>
                    <p id="p-30" data-page="46901">DoD has determined that it is in the best interest of the Federal Government to apply the rule to contracts and subcontracts for the acquisition of commercial products, commercial services, and COTS items, as defined at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 2.101. Not applying this rule to contracts and subcontracts for such acquisitions would exclude contracts intended to be covered by this rule and undermine the overarching purpose for the rule to restrict the purchase of large medium-speed diesel engines for auxiliary ships, unless the engines are manufactured in the national technology and industrial base, which is defined at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/4801" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 4801(1)</a>.</p>
                    <h2 id="h-17">IV. Expected Impact of the Rule</h2>

The review of the FPDS data revealed that there was a total of 241 awards, of which 121 were made to small businesses, a median of 50 percent awarded to small entities during those three fiscal years.</p>
