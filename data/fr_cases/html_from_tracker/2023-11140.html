                <h2 id="h-7">I. Background</h2>
                <p id="p-7" data-page="33834">DoD is amending the DFARS to implement section 842 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/117/public/263" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 117-263</a>), which amends <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/4022" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 4022(f)(2)</a> to permit the award of a follow-on production contract without the use of competitive procedures, even if explicit notification was not listed within the request for proposal for the prototype project transaction. This revision modifies the criteria required to award a follow-on production contract without the use of competitive procedures at DFARS 206.001-70(a), which requires other transaction solicitations and agreements to include provisions for a follow-on contract in order to qualify for an exception to competition requirements.</p>
                <p id="p-8" data-page="33834">The statutory revision to the criteria does not implement new requirements; instead it removes one of the requirements. The statutes and regulations that implement DoD's other transactions authority permit DoD to provide, in the agreement, for the award of a follow-on production contract to a participant in the prototype project. Agreements made under DoD's other transactions authority are not subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) or DFARS; however, the award of a follow-on production contract resulting from such an other transaction agreement is subject to these acquisition regulations.</p>
                <p id="p-9" data-page="33834">DoD issued a final rule for DFARS case 2019-D031 (<a href="/citation/87-FR-10989" class="fr-reference" data-reference="87 FR 10989">87 FR 10989</a>) on February 28, 2022, to implement section 815 of the NDAA for FY 2016 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/114/public/92" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 114-92</a>), which modified the criteria required to exempt from competition certain follow-on production contracts at DFARS 206.001-70(a)(1) and (2).</p>
                <p id="p-10" data-page="33834">This final rule removes from DFARS 206.001-70(a)(1) the other transaction solicitation requirement and clarifies that an other transaction agreement is still statutorily required (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/4022" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 4022(f)(1)</a>) to provide for the award of a follow-on production contract in order for a contracting officer to award the follow-on production contract without obtaining competition. DFARS 206.001-70(a)(2) is revised to require documentation from the agreements officer for the other transaction agreement that, where applicable for the prototype project, the threshold at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/4022" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 4022(a)(2)(C)</a> and the requirements at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/4022" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 4022(f)(2)(A)</a> and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/4022" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(B)</a> have been met. These and additional revisions in 206.001-70(a) are intended to ensure an accurate interpretation of the statutory requirements of <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/4022" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 4022</a> that are subject to the DFARS.</p>
                <h2 id="h-8">II. Publication of This Final Rule for Public Comment Is Not Required by Statute</h2>
                <p id="p-11" data-page="33834">The statute that applies to the publication of the FAR is <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1707" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1707</a>, Publication of Proposed Regulations. Subsection (a)(1) of the statute requires that a procurement policy, regulation, procedure, or form (including an amendment or modification thereof) must be published for public comment if it relates to the expenditure of appropriated funds, and has either a significant effect beyond the internal operating procedures of the agency issuing the policy, regulation, procedure, or form, or has a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors. This final rule is not required to be published for public comment, because DoD is removing a requirement that is no longer mandated by statute and that affects only the internal operating procedures of DoD.</p>
                <h2 id="h-9">III. Applicability to Contracts at or Below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT), for Commercial Services and for Commercial Products, Including Commercially Available Off-the-Shelf (COTS) Items</h2>
                <p id="p-12" data-page="33834">This rule does not impose any new requirements on contracts at or below the simplified acquisition threshold, for commercial services, or for commercial products, including commercially available off-the-shelf items.</p>
                <h2 id="h-10">IV. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563</h2>
                <p id="p-13" data-page="33834">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993.</p>
                <h2 id="h-11">V. Congressional Review Act</h2>
                <p id="p-14" data-page="33834">
                    As required by the Congressional Review Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/801" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 801-808</a>) before an interim or final rule takes effect, DoD will submit a copy of the interim or final rule with the form, Submission of Federal Rules Under the Congressional Review Act, to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and to the Comptroller General of the United States. A major rule under the

                    Congressional Review Act cannot take effect until 60 days after it is published in the 
                    <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                    . The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has determined that this rule is not a major rule as defined by <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/804" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 804</a>.
                </p>

                <p id="p-15" data-page="33835">The Regulatory Flexibility Act does not apply to this rule because this final rule does not constitute a significant DFARS revision within the meaning of FAR 1.501-1, and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1707" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1707</a> does not require publication for public comment.</p>
