                        DoD published a proposed rule in the

                         at <a href="/citation/86-FR-48368" class="fr-reference" data-reference="86 FR 48368">86 FR 48368</a> on August 30, 2021, to implement section 803 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/116/public/92" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub.

Five respondents submitted public comments in response to the proposed rule.

                    <p id="p-8" data-page="65502">DoD revised DFARS 215.403-3(a)(1) to include the word &ldquo;subcontract&rdquo; to clarify that, in accordance with section 803 of the NDAA for FY 2020, the rule applies to subcontractors. One respondent suggested this revision.</p>

                    <h4 id="h-11">1. Clarification of the Requirement Not To Base Price-Reasonableness Solely on Historical Prices Paid by the Government</h4>
                    <p id="p-10" data-page="65502">
                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         Three respondents expressed confusion with the requirement not to base price reasonableness solely on historical prices paid by the Government. Multiple respondents requested clarification on the restriction of use of previously performed cost and price analysis. Another respondent expressed concern with inclusion of the requirement in multiple sections and recommended that the requirement should be clearly connected to other relevant factors such as time elapsed since prior purchase, and any differences in quantities purchased as part of the price reasonableness determination.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-11" data-page="65502">
                        <em>Response:</em>
                         The rule does not prohibit contracting officers from utilizing prior cost or price analyses, nor does it absolutely prohibit contracting officers from utilizing historical prices paid by the Government to determine prices fair and reasonable. Rather, the rule prohibits contracting officers from determining the price of a contract to be fair and reasonable based solely on historical prices paid by the Government. Under this rule, historical prices paid by the Government cannot properly comprise the only factor when determining prices fair and reasonable, but rather may be used as one factor among several. Inclusion of the requirement in DFARS 215.403-3 was intentional to ensure the contracting officer is aware of the requirement in the event that prior prices paid by the Government are the only information available, and other than certified cost or pricing data will likely have to be

                        obtained. The respondents' recommendation to clearly connect the requirement to other relevant factors was not incorporated as it already exists in DFARS 215.404-1(b)(ii). Accordingly, no changes to the rule are necessary as a result of these comments.
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="h-12">2. Application of the Rule to Subcontracts and Flowdown Requirements</h4>
                    <p id="p-12" data-page="65503">
                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         Four respondents questioned whether the requirement flowed down to subcontracts. One respondent questioned whether or not the contractor would need to develop a package for the contracting officer to submit to the HCA for a determination that the purchase is in the best interest of the Government, or if the determination that the purchase is in the best interest of the Government could be made by an official of the contractor. Another respondent inquired whether contracting officers would be required to provide previous prices paid to contractors, and if there would be a requirement that contractors be prohibited from making a price reasonableness determination based solely on historical prices paid by the contractor. Further, another respondent questioned whether the contractors would be required to track information about subcontractors providing cost data, similar to the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS).
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-13" data-page="65503">
                        <em>Response:</em>
                         The rule does apply to subcontracts, and DoD concurs with adding the word &ldquo;subcontract&rdquo; to 215.403-3(a)(4) to reflect the statutory language at section 803 of the NDAA for FY 2020. The contractor would not need to develop a package for the contracting officer to submit to the HCA. The HCA would be making that decision based upon the inputs from the Government team, whether it was at the prime or subcontract level, and any inputs from the contractor would be limited to providing supporting data to the contracting officer. The Government would not be able to disclose price information unless the contractors involved agreed to the release of the data. The contracting officer would be responsible to assess and evaluate the analysis performed by the prime on their subcontractors to ensure they considered additional data aside from the previous prices paid. Contractors will not be required to track information about subcontractors providing cost data similar to CPARS. The contracting officer would be responsible for tracking this information for prime contractors and subcontractors.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent recommended augmenting DFARS 252.215-7010 with additional requirements intended to maximize cooperation from offerors when contracting officers make data requests.

                         One respondent recommended amending DFARS 215.404-1(b)(v)(C) to change the term &ldquo;customer,&rdquo; to &ldquo;type of customer.&rdquo;

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         Two respondents recommended revising the final rule at DFARS 215.403-3(a)(4), to include, in accordance with section 803 of the NDAA for FY 2020, the requirement that offerors make good faith efforts when complying with the Government's reasonable requests to furnish data other than certified cost or pricing data.

                    <p id="p-21" data-page="65503">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility.

Section 803 provides additional requirements for contracting officers and the head of the contracting activity relating to obtaining data other than certified cost or pricing data.</p>
                    <p id="p-25" data-page="65503">DoD received no public comments in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis.</p>
                    <p id="p-26" data-page="65503">This rule does not directly impose requirements on small entities. The section 803 requirement making certain offerors ineligible for award is already in the Federal Acquisition Regulation. This rule impacts (1) the contracting officer's need for data other than historical prices paid by the Government, unless there is adequate price competition; and (2) the criteria for the head of the contracting activity's determination to make an award. In some cases, the contracting officer's need for data other than historical prices paid by the Government may result in a request for additional data from an offeror. Based on data from the Federal Procurement Data System for FY 2018 through FY 2020, DoD estimates that 1,672 small entities may receive a request for additional data.</p>
