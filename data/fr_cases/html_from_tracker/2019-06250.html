                <h2 id="h-7">I. Background</h2>
                <p id="p-7" data-page="12140">DoD is issuing a final rule to amend the DFARS to implement section 824 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2019, which amends section 893 of the NDAA for FY 2011 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/111/public/383" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 111-383</a>) regarding consent to subcontract requirements. Specifically, section 893 requires contracting officers to have written approval from the program manager prior to withholding consent to subcontract for DoD contracts with contractors that have approved purchasing systems, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 44.101.</p>
                <h2 id="h-8">II. Discussion and Analysis</h2>
                <p id="p-8" data-page="12140">
                    This rule proposes to add a new paragraph (a) at DFARS 244.201-1 to include the new requirement for contracting officers to obtain written approval from the program manager prior to withholding a consent to subcontract for DoD contracts with contractors that have an approved purchasing system. Conforming changes are made to the existing text at 244.201-1, by renumbering the existing text as paragraph (S-70).

                <h2 id="h-9">III. Applicability to Contracts at or Below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold and for Commercial Items, Including Commercially Available Off-the-Shelf Items</h2>
                <p id="p-9" data-page="12141">This rule does not create any new provisions or clauses or impact any existing provisions or clauses. The rule only impacts the internal operating procedures of the agency. As such, the rule does not impose any new requirements on contracts at or below the simplified acquisition threshold or for commercial items, including commercially available off-the-shelf items.</p>
                <h2 id="h-10">IV. Publication of This Final Rule for Public Comment Is Not Required by Statute</h2>
                <p id="p-10" data-page="12141">The statute that applies to the publication of the FAR is <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1707" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1707</a> entitled &ldquo;Publication of Proposed Regulations.&rdquo; Paragraph (a)(1) of the statute requires that a procurement policy, regulation, procedure, or form (including an amendment or modification thereof) must be published for public comment if it relates to the expenditure of appropriated funds, and has either a significant effect beyond the internal operating procedures of the agency issuing the policy, regulation, procedure, or form, or has a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors. This final rule is not required to be published for public comment, because this rule merely establishes internal Government procedures for contracting officers to obtain written approval from the program manager prior to withholding a consent to subcontract on a contract with a contractor with an approved purchasing system.</p>

                <p id="p-11" data-page="12141">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, or reducing costs, or harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993.

                <h2 id="h-13">VII. Regulatory Flexibility Act</h2>
                <p id="p-13" data-page="12141">
                    Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment are not required to be given for this rule under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1707" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1707(a)(1)</a> (see section IV. of this preamble), the analytical requirement of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>
