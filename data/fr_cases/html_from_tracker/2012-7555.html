                <h1 id="h-6">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</h1>
                <h2 id="h-7">I. Background</h2>
                <p id="p-6" data-page="19132">This rule implements section 809(b) of the NDAA for FY 2012 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/112/public/81" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 112-81</a>), which removes the requirement that the head of the agency must notify the congressional defense committees within 30 days for each single source task- or delivery-order contract award over $103 million.</p>
                <h2 id="h-8">II. Publication of This Final Rule for Public Comment Is Not Required by Statute</h2>
                <p id="p-7" data-page="19132">&ldquo;Publication of proposed regulations&rdquo;, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1707" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1707</a>, is the statute that applies to the publication of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Paragraph (a)(1) of the statute requires that a procurement policy, regulation, procedure or form (including an amendment or modification thereof) must be published for public comment if it relates to the expenditure of appropriated funds, and has either a significant effect beyond the internal operating procedures of the agency issuing the policy, regulation, procedure or form, or has a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors. This final rule is not required to be published for public comment, because the rule merely removes the requirement for the head of the agency to notify congressional defense committees for each single source task- or delivery-order contract award over $103 million. These requirements affect only the internal operating procedures of the Government.</p>
                <h2 id="h-9">III. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563</h2>
                <p id="p-8" data-page="19132">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993. This rule is not a major rule under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/804" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 804</a>.</p>
                <h2 id="h-10">IV. Regulatory Flexibility Act</h2>
                <p id="p-9" data-page="19132">The Regulatory Flexibility Act does not apply to this rule because this final rule does not constitute a significant DFARS revision as defined at FAR 1.501-1, and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1707" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1707</a> does not require publication for public comment.</p>
                <h2 id="h-11">V. Paperwork Reduction Act</h2>
                <p id="p-10" data-page="19132">The rule does not contain any information collection requirements that require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/44/3501" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44 U.S.C. chapter 35</a>).</p>
