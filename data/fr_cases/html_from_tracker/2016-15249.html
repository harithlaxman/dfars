                <p id="p-6" data-page="42562">
                    DoD published a proposed rule in the 
                    <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                     at <a href="/citation/81-FR-17053" class="fr-reference" data-reference="81 FR 17053">81 FR 17053</a> on March 25, 2016, to implement section 897 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/114/public/92" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 114-92</a>). Section 897 provides that contracts executed by DoD as a result of the transfer of contracts from the General Services Administration or for which DoD serves as an item manager for products on behalf of the General Services Administration shall not be subject to the requirements under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/14801" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. chapter 148</a> (National Defense Technology and Industrial Base, Defense Investment, and Defense Conversion), to the extent that such contracts are for the purchase of products by other Federal agencies or State or local governments. One respondent submitted public comments in response to the proposed rule.

                <p id="p-7" data-page="42562">There are no changes from the proposed rule made in the final rule. The one respondent that submitted a comment fully supported the proposed rule.</p>

                <p id="p-9" data-page="42562">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993.

                <p id="p-10" data-page="42562">
                    A final regulatory flexibility analysis (FRFA) has been prepared consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>, 
                    <em>et seq.</em>
                     The FRFA is summarized as follows:
                </p>
                <p id="p-11" data-page="42562">This rule implements section 897 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016. The objective of this rule is to eliminate the domestic source restrictions of <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/14801" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. chapter 148</a> when contracts executed by DoD as a result of the transfer of contracts from the General Services Administration or for which DoD serves as an item manager for products on behalf of the General Services Administration, to the extent that such contracts are for the purchase of products by other Federal agencies or State or local governments.</p>
                <p id="p-12" data-page="42562">There were no significant issues raised by the public in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis.</p>
                <p id="p-13" data-page="42562">DoD does not anticipate frequent application of this rule. The rule removes the domestic source restriction for the specified items in the specified circumstances. In the rare instance in which the circumstances of the statute apply, it is possible that an item could be acquired from a foreign source, rather than a domestic source, which could potentially be a small business. It is not possible to estimate the number of small entities that may be affected, because it is unknown the extent to which the given circumstances may occur.</p>
                <p id="p-14" data-page="42562">There are no projected reporting, recordkeeping, or other compliance requirements.</p>
                <p id="p-15" data-page="42562">DoD has not identified any alternatives that would minimize any economic impact on small entities and still meet the requirements of the statute.</p>
                <h2 id="h-12">VI. Paperwork Reduction Act</h2>
                <p id="p-16" data-page="42562">The rule does not contain any information collection requirements that require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/44/3501" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44 U.S.C. chapter 35</a>).</p>
