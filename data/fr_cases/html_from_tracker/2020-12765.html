Similarly for sealed bidding, upon request by a contractor, the contracting officer shall modify the contract without requiring consideration to replace the relevant clause.

                    <p id="p-8" data-page="40072">DoD, GSA, and NASA published a proposed rule on October 2, 2019, at <a href="/citation/84-FR-52428" class="fr-reference" data-reference="84 FR 52428">84 FR 52428</a>, to increase the threshold for requesting certified cost or pricing data from $750,000 to $2 million for contracts entered into after June 30, 2018. The threshold for Cost Accounting Standards applicability is required by <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1502" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1502(b)(1)(B)</a> to be the same threshold as the one for requesting certified cost or pricing data.</p>

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent suggested revision of FAR 15.403-4(a)(3) to reflect the $2 million threshold for both prime contracts and subcontracts entered into on and after July 1, 2018, to ensure consistency across the entire Truth in Negotiations Act certification process.

                         The Councils cannot accept the suggestion because it is not consistent with the statute being implemented.

                    <p id="p-17" data-page="40072">DoD, GSA, and NASA have performed a regulatory cost analysis on this rule. The following is a summary of the estimated public and Government cost savings. This rule will impact large and small businesses which currently compete on solicitations issued using FAR part 15 negotiation procedures and are valued between $750,000 and $2 million as these firms will no longer be required to submit certified cost or pricing data between those amounts. In addition, because of the comparable increase in the cost accounting standards threshold, fewer contractors will be required to comply with FAR clauses that implement the cost accounting standards. The following is a summary of the estimated cost savings calculated in 2016 dollars at a 7-percent discount rate and in perpetuity:</p>

                        DoD, GSA, and NASA have prepared a Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (FRFA) consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>, 
                        <em>et seq.</em>
                         The FRFA is summarized as follows:
                    </p>
                    
                        <p id="p-23" data-page="40073">This rule is required to implement section 811 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 which amends <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2306a" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2306a</a> and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/3502" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 3502</a> to increase the threshold for requesting certified cost or pricing data from $750,000 to $2 million. The threshold for Cost Accounting Standards applicability is required by <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1502" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1502(b)(1)(B)</a> to be the same threshold as the one for requesting certified cost or pricing data.</p>
                        <p id="p-24" data-page="40073">There were no significant issues raised by the public in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis.</p>
                        <p id="p-25" data-page="40073">This rule will impact small entities who compete on solicitations issued using FAR part 15, Contracting by Negotiation, valued between $750,000 and $2 million. It also impacts subcontracts and contract modifications, including those contracts awarded under sealed bidding procedures, valued between $750,000 and $2 million. Offerors and contractors under the revised threshold will no longer be required to submit &ldquo;certified cost or pricing data&rdquo; and will now submit &ldquo;data other than certified cost or pricing data,&rdquo; which takes less time to prepare.</p>
                        <p id="p-26" data-page="40073">In order to calculate the savings due to the increased threshold, the same FY 2016 Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) data was utilized that was used to calculate information collection burdens associated with submission of certified cost or pricing data and of data other than certified cost or pricing data under the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Control Number 9000-0013, which was cleared in January 2018. For contracts and orders awarded using FAR part 15 that were valued between $750,000 and $2 million, reflecting the actions impacted by the increase in the threshold, there were 2,697 contract awards/orders issued, 636 modifications to contracts or orders, an estimated 1,288 subcontracts awarded, and 592 subcontract modifications. Of these responses, 3,364 were from small entities. Of the 1,871 small entities that were awarded contracts or issued orders, 1,501 were unique small entities (about 1.25 contracts/orders per small entity). We estimate a comparable ratio of actions to entities in the other categories. This ratio is less than the overall ratio of actions to entities because this is just a small slice of the total range covered by the information collection clearance. The cost accounting standards do not apply to small entities, therefore that threshold change only affects other than small entities.</p>
                        <p id="p-27" data-page="40073">The rule does not include additional reporting or record keeping requirements.</p>
                        <p id="p-28" data-page="40073">There are no available alternatives to the rule to accomplish the desired objective of the statute. However, the impact on small entities will be beneficial, as it will relieve them of the requirement to provide certified cost or pricing data when the acquisition is less than $2 million. Instead, in most cases they would submit data other than certified cost or pricing data which is estimated to save 40 hours of labor effort and related cost savings for each submission not requiring certification.</p>

OMB has cleared this information collection requirement under OMB Control Numbers: 9000-0013, Certified Cost or Pricing Data and Data Other Than Certified Cost or Pricing Data, and 9000-0129, Cost Accounting Standards Administration. No comments were received on the revision to OMB Control Number 9000-0013 that was provided in the proposed rule.
