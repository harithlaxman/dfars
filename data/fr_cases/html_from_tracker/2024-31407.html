                    <p id="p-6" data-page="523">DoD, GSA, and NASA published a proposed rule at <a href="/citation/89-FR-48540" class="fr-reference" data-reference="89 FR 48540">89 FR 48540</a> on June 7, 2024, to implement regulatory changes made by the Small Business Administration (SBA) in its final rules published on October 16, 2020 (<a href="/citation/85-FR-66146" class="fr-reference" data-reference="85 FR 66146">85 FR 66146</a>) and on August 19, 2022 (<a href="/citation/87-FR-50925" class="fr-reference" data-reference="87 FR 50925">87 FR 50925</a>) to implement section 861 of <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/115/public/232" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Public Law 115-232</a> and section 866 of <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/116/public/283" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Public Law 116-283</a>.

                         The respondents expressed support for the change at 19.702, which specifies that subcontracting plans are not required from Alaska Native Corporations (ANCs).

                         The Councils acknowledge the respondents' support for this change. SBA clarified that an ANC prime contractor is required to submit a subcontracting plan if they are large for the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to the contract. However, an ANC subcontractor is treated as a small business concern by statute and, therefore, cannot be required to submit a subcontracting plan (

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         The respondents recommended changes to the proposed rule text at FAR 19.703(2)(i) and (ii) and in the clauses at FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns, and 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, which specify that a contractor may rely on a subcontractor's representation unless it has reason to question it. A respondent recommended the word &ldquo;question&rdquo; be replaced with &ldquo;doubt&rdquo; to align with SBA's regulations at <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-13/section-121.404#p-121.404(e)" class="cfr external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">13 CFR 121.404(e)</a>, indicating the word &ldquo;doubt&rdquo; means, in accordance with the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, to call into question the truth of, to lack confidence in, and to consider unlikely, whereas &ldquo;question&rdquo; simply means to ask a question. Another respondent recommended the text be amended to specify: &ldquo;unless the contractor has an objective, evidence-based reason to question a representation for clarity&rdquo;.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-15" data-page="523">
                        <em>Response:</em>
                         In this context, SBA's term &ldquo;doubt&rdquo; has the same meaning as the FAR term &ldquo;question&rdquo;. The FAR consistently uses the term &ldquo;question&rdquo; when specifying that a contracting officer may rely on a representation or certification unless the contracting officer has a reason to question the representation or certification. Aligning the proposed rule text with text currently used in the FAR for other representations or certifications helps promote certainty and avoids confusion for the contracting community. Moreover, the FAR does not replicate terminology used in SBA's regulations; instead SBA's regulations are translated into FAR terminology. This rule implements SBA's regulations at <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-13/section-121.404#p-121.404(e)" class="cfr external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">13 CFR 121.404(e)</a>, which do not specify that the contractor is required to have an objective, evidence-based reason to question a representation. There are a variety of reasons why a contractor might question a subcontractor's representation and this text is written so as to not limit the basis on which a contractor may question such a representation.

                        <em>C. Other changes.</em>
                         The proposed rule FAR text at 19.702(b)(1) is moved in the final rule to FAR 19.704(a)(9) and to paragraph (d)(9) of the clause at FAR 52.219-9 and its Alternate IV to specify for contractors that subcontracting plans are not required from their subcontractors that are treated as small business concerns by statute. Conforming changes are made to the clause at FAR 52.219-9 and its Alternates III and IV.

                    <h2 id="h-9">III. Applicability to Contracts at or Below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT) and for Commercial Products (Including Commercially Available Off-the-Shelf (COTS) Items) or for Commercial Services</h2>
                    <p id="p-17" data-page="523">
                        This rule amends the clauses at FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders&mdash;Commercial Products and Commercial Services; 52.213-4, Terms and Conditions&mdash;Simplified Acquisitions (Other Than Commercial Products and Commercial Services); 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns; and 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan. However, this rule does not change the applicability of these clauses, which continue to apply to contracts valued at or below the SAT, or on contracts for commercial products, including COTS items, or commercial services. This rule applies paragraphs (a) and (d) of section 861 of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/115/public/232" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 115-232</a>), and paragraphs (a) and (c) of section 866 of the NDAA for FY 2021 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/116/public/283" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 116-283</a>), to acquisitions at or below the SAT and to acquisitions for commercial products, including COTS items, and commercial services, as the two new incentives for SBA's mentor-prot&eacute;g&eacute; program are available to all contractors in the program, regardless of the dollar value of the contract awarded or the commercial nature of the products and services procured.

                    <h3 id="h-10">A. Applicability to Contracts at or Below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold</h3>
                    <p id="p-18" data-page="524">The statute at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1905" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1905</a> governs the applicability of laws to acquisitions at or below the SAT. Section 1905 generally limits the applicability of new laws when agencies are making acquisitions at or below the SAT, but provides that such acquisitions will not be exempt from a provision of law under certain circumstances, including when the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (FAR Council) makes a written determination and finding that it would not be in the best interest of the Federal Government to exempt contracts and subcontracts in amounts not greater than the SAT from the provision of law. The FAR Council has made a determination to apply this statute to acquisitions at or below the SAT.</p>
                    <h3 id="h-11">B. Applicability to Contracts for the Acquisition of Commercial Products and Commercial Services, Including Commercially Available Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Items</h3>

Section 1906 provides that if the FAR Council makes a written determination that it is not in the best interest of the Federal Government to exempt commercial contracts, the provision of law will apply to contracts for the acquisition of commercial products and commercial services.</p>
                    <p id="p-20" data-page="524">The statute at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1907" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1907</a> states that acquisitions of COTS items will be exempt from certain provisions of law unless the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy makes a written determination and finds that it would not be in the best interest of the Federal Government to exempt contracts for the procurement of COTS items.</p>

                    <p id="p-22" data-page="524">This rule is expected to benefit mentors with an SBA-approved mentor-prot&eacute;g&eacute; agreement that subcontract to covered territory small businesses and small businesses that have their principal office located in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. These benefits are expected to extend to covered territory small businesses and small businesses located in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, as mentors may be incentivized to enter into SBA-approved mentor-prot&eacute;g&eacute; agreements with such small businesses and issue subcontracts to them.</p>
                    <p id="p-23" data-page="524">
                        This rule is expected to decrease the burden for certain entities that are treated as small business concerns by statute for certain purposes (
                        <em>e.g.,</em>
                         ANCs), as these entities will not be required to submit subcontracting plans as subcontractors.

                    <h2 id="h-14">VI. Congressional Review Act</h2>
                    <p id="p-25" data-page="524">Pursuant to the Congressional Review Act, DoD, GSA, and NASA will send this rule to each House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General of the United States.

The FRFA is summarized as follows:</p>
                    
                        <p id="p-27" data-page="524">DoD, GSA, and NASA are issuing a final rule amending the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to implement regulatory changes made by the Small Business Administration (SBA) in its final rule published on October 16, 2020, at <a href="/citation/85-FR-66146" class="fr-reference" data-reference="85 FR 66146">85 FR 66146</a>, to implement section 861 of the John S.

L. 115-232</a>). The objective of this rule is to implement SBA's final rule and to implement section 861, which amended <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/15/657r" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15 U.S.C. 657r(a)</a> to add Puerto Rico to the list of territories from which small businesses are eligible for preferential treatment under the SBA mentor-prot&eacute;g&eacute; program. This rule also implements SBA's final rule published on August 19, 2022, at <a href="/citation/87-FR-50925" class="fr-reference" data-reference="87 FR 50925">87 FR 50925</a> to implement section 866 of the NDAA for FY 2021 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/116/public/283" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 116-283</a>), which amended <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/15/657r" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15 U.S.C. 657r(a)</a> and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/15/632" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15 U.S.C. 632(ff)</a> to add the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) to the list of territories from which small businesses are eligible for preferential treatment under the SBA mentor-prot&eacute;g&eacute; programs. Section 866 also defines a &ldquo;covered territory business&rdquo; as a small business concern that has its principal office located in one of the following: (1) the U.S. Virgin Islands; (2) American Samoa; (3) Guam; and (4) CNMI. Sections 861 and 866 created two new incentives for SBA's small business mentor-prot&eacute;g&eacute; program for mentor-prot&eacute;g&eacute; pairs in which the prot&eacute;g&eacute; has its principal office located in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or is a covered territory business. Specifically, such a mentor that subcontracts to its prot&eacute;g&eacute; is able to receive positive consideration for the mentor's past performance evaluation and is able to apply the costs of training its prot&eacute;g&eacute; to its subcontracting plan goals. This rule also specifies the entities that are not required to submit subcontracting plans as subcontractors.</p>

According to data from the Federal Procurement Data System, in the last three fiscal years, the Government awarded contracts to small businesses in the covered territories and in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico as follows: 506 in fiscal year (FY) 2021, 438 in FY 2022, and 435 in FY 2023, which averages out to approximately 460 contracts per year. Each of those awards was made to a unique small entity. In addition, and according to data from the System for Award Management (SAM), there are 6,318 small businesses in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico that are currently registered in SAM. Although the Government awarded approximately 460 contracts to 460 unique small entities and there are 6,318 small entities in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the number of small entities to which this rule will apply cannot be more precisely estimated as the number of entities that may enter into SBA-approved mentor-prot&eacute;g&eacute; agreements is unknown.</p>
