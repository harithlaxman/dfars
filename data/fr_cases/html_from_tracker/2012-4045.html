                        DoD published an initial proposed rule for Business Systems&mdash;Definition and Administration (DFARS Case 2009-D038) in the 
                        <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                         on January 15, 2010 (<a href="/citation/75-FR-2457" class="fr-reference" data-reference="75 FR 2457">75 FR 2457</a>). Based on the comments received, DoD published a second proposed rule on December 3, 2010 (<a href="/citation/75-FR-75550" class="fr-reference" data-reference="75 FR 75550">75 FR 75550</a>). The public comment period closed January 10, 2011. On January 7, 2011, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2011 was signed into law (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/111/public/383" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 111-383</a>). Section 893 of the NDAA for FY 2011, Contractor Business Systems, set forth statutory requirements for the improvement of contractor business systems to ensure that such systems provide timely, reliable information for the management of DoD programs. Based on the comments received in response to the second proposed rule and the requirements of the NDAA for FY 2011, DoD published an interim rule with request for comments on May 18, 2011 (<a href="/citation/76-FR-28856" class="fr-reference" data-reference="76 FR 28856">76 FR 28856</a>). The public comment period ended on July 18, 2011. Comments were received from 14 respondents in response to the interim rule.

                         A respondent stated that DFARS 252.242-7006(c)(8) is vague. Periodic monitoring of the system can take many forms and be performed by numerous personnel. The respondent suggested that wording more in line with DFARS 252.244-7001(c)(18), DFARS 252.215-7002(d)(4)(xii), or DFARS 252.215-7002(d)(4)(xiii) would better state who is expected to perform the monitoring, why the monitoring is being performed, and would give a clearer expectation of level of monitoring to be performed.

                         The size and complexity of companies and their processes, operations, and accounting systems capabilities vary. Therefore, it is not feasible to establish specific requirements regarding the extent or frequency of monitoring by the contractor. However, the term &ldquo;periodic&rdquo; has been removed and additional language has been added, similar to the language at 252.244-7001 and 252.215-7002, to clarify that the contractor's accounting system shall provide for management reviews or internal audits of the contractor's system to ensure compliance with the contractor's policies, procedures, and established accounting practices.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         A &ldquo;covered contract&rdquo; is defined at DFARS 242.7000(a) as one that is subject to Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). A respondent stated that the problem with this prescription is that a contracting officer will not typically know if the resulting contract will be subject to CAS when drafting the solicitation. A determination as to whether CAS applies to a particular contract is made after the offeror submits an offer containing the information required by the provision at FAR 52.230-1, Cost Accounting Notices and Certification. The contracting officer then inserts the appropriate CAS clauses in the contract, if necessary. The respondent suggested that one way to correct this is to add a paragraph to the clause making it self-deleting if CAS does not apply to the contract.

                         Section 816 of the NDAA for 2012 redefined &ldquo;covered contract&rdquo; as &ldquo;a contract that is subject to the cost accounting standards promulgated pursuant to <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1502" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">section 1502 of title 41, United States Code</a>, that could be affected if the data produced by a contractor business system has a significant deficiency.&rdquo; The section 816 definition matches the definition used in this rule, therefore, no revisions are necessary.

                         The language at DFARS 242.7502(a) applies to any contracts that provide for progress payments based on costs or on a percentage or stage of completion. Adding the words &ldquo;fixed-price&rdquo; before the second instance of the word &ldquo;contract&rdquo; is not compatible with the intent of DFARS 242.7502(a). However, DFARS 242.7503(b) has been revised to delete the fixed-price modifier so that the two sentences are consistent.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         A respondent stated that the proposed change to require administrative contracting officer (ACO) determination of property management system compliance is inconsistent with ACO determinations of other business systems. According to the respondent, except for property management, all business systems proposed for ACO determination of acceptability are reviewed by DCAA functional specialists outside of the DCMA or Program Office organizational structures, or by functional specialists who do not have a defined career field certification standard and warrant/letter of appointment. In those instances, functional specialist recommendations are advisory and the ACO determination of system status is necessary. The respondent stated that property management system compliance differs from the system status determinations cited in the proposed change in that property administrator certification/qualification requirements are identified under the unique Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act (DAWIA) career field certification standard for industrial contract property management and they are issued letters of appointment, which requires them to routinely perform their duties as warranted contracting officers and communicate system status determinations. According to the respondent, ACO responsibility for determinations of property management system compliance does not support consistent treatment of contractors assigned for DCMA administration. The respondent noted that the DCMA Centers concept was established when it was found that certain specialty functions such as property, plant clearance, terminations, transportation, etc., suffered declines in communications and technical expertise due to lack of functional supervision. Within DCMA, infrastructure and tools to support consistency in property management reside in the DCMA Business Centers, not with the Chief Operating Officer/Chief Management Officer. Government Accountability Office Standards require performance of duties by appropriate, trained personnel. The respondent suggested that ACOs do not have the appropriate competencies (knowledge, skills, and abilities) to perform this function.

                         DAWIA requirements for the industrial property management specialist workforce do not alter, and are not inconsistent with DFARS requirements for contracting officers to make determinations regarding a contractor's business system approval or disapproval. This responsibility exists apart from DAWIA requirements for acquisition personnel and regardless of agency processes for formally appointing individuals as property administrators or plant clearance officers. The DFARS rule does not contemplate or require contracting officers to have technical expertise in each of the six identified business systems. Contracting officers will continue to rely on functional specialists to perform the necessary contractor systems reviews as they always have. DCMA's &ldquo;Center&rdquo; concept is not universal to all of DCMA property operations. For example, a number of property administrators and plant clearance officers do not report operationally to the property center (now referred to as the property &ldquo;group&rdquo;), and instead report directly to DCMA International. DFARS 245.105 is clear that Government property administrators are responsible for providing recommendations and reporting system deficiencies to the cognizant contracting officer, including recommendations regarding contractor property management system approval or disapproval. However, the authority for a determination of system approval or disapproval shall remain with the cognizant contracting officer who is also responsible for applying a payment withhold for disapproved business systems in accordance with DFARS 252.242-7005, Contractor Business Systems.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         A number of respondents stated that the interim rule does not address DoD officials working with the contractor to remediate deficiencies or to develop a corrective action plan. The NDAA for FY 2011 contains the requirement for DoD officials to work with the contractor to correct cited deficiencies. The respondents suggested that this language be explicitly stated in the final rule along with additional language that would promote a &ldquo;team effort&rdquo; resolution of any significant deficiency. Further, the respondents suggested that the Government should be required to consider mitigating controls as part of any evaluation as to the reliability of information produced by a business system(s).

                         The language in the rule complies with the NDAA for FY 2011. The rule identifies cognizant contracting officers as the DoD officials who are available to work with contractors in the process of identifying significant deficiencies, accepting corrective action plans, and monitoring the contractor's progress in correcting the deficiencies. Contracting officers will notify the contractor, in writing, providing a description of each significant deficiency in sufficient detail to allow the contractor to understand the deficiency, and then identify any issues with a contractor's corrective action plan.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         A respondent stated that DCAA does not have a clean audit opinion on the integrity of the audits they perform; reliance is being placed on an audit agency that must qualify its own audit reports. According to the respondent, the GAO audit reports cited the DCAA for many deficiencies that bring into question the validity of audit reports issued against contractors' business systems. The respondent stated that DCAA should not be viewed as the experts and withholds should not be based on audit reports or audit report quality control systems of questionable validity. The respondent asserted that the Government is attempting to hold contractors to a level of perfection that their own audit agency is unable to maintain. Consequently, the respondent suggested that the audit report should not be used as the sole foundation for a contracting officer's determination of system adequacy, particularly if regulatory withholding of payment will be the result.

                         Currently, DCAA reports for audits performed in accordance with Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS) must be qualified because the current external opinion has expired. This qualification solely states that the time frame required by GAGAS for an external peer review has expired. Outside of this exception, all of DCAA's audits are being performed in accordance with GAGAS. Furthermore, the objective of the rule is to ensure that contractor business systems provide timely, reliable information for the management of DoD programs. Contracting personnel will make appropriate determinations in accordance with this rule.

                         A number of respondents stated that DCAA and DCMA are not properly staffed to address the new DFARS rule. Further, with regard to EVMS, the rule provides extensive authority to contracting officers and DCAA and DCMA auditors in evaluating implementation of the ANSI/EIA 748 standard, which was intentionally designed to be flexible. According to the respondents, the magnitude of programs and contractors requiring EVMS surveillance and assessment inherently results in less experienced personnel in positions with this authority. The respondents suggested that Government resources are not adequate in numbers or depth of skills to provide the required oversight.

                         This rule does not add additional oversight responsibilities to DCAA and DCMA, but instead mitigates the Government's risk when contractors fail to maintain business systems, as is required by the terms and conditions of their contracts. Contracting personnel will continue to make appropriate determinations in accordance with this rule. DoD has been taking measures to align resources and ensure work is complementary. The increased cooperation and coordination between DCAA and DCMA will enable DoD to employ audit resources where they are needed.

Some system deficiencies can be corrected almost immediately, leaving the withhold in place until DCAA completes its follow-up audit. According to the respondent, reducing the percentage of the withhold to half of the initial percentage will still place contractors in a financial crisis. The respondent stated that contractors will have to increase their bids to cover potential withholds, which would increase the overall price to the Government.

                         A respondent stated that the withholding of payments could lessen competition and endanger national security. According to the respondent, national security in many respects is dependent on contractors. From weapon systems to wartime services, contractors perform a vital role in national security. The respondent stated that the economic times are bleak, which is already requiring contractors to operate on thin margins. The respondent expressed concern that if a contractor has a withhold placed upon its billings and is unable to meet financial obligations and, therefore, is unable to meets its contractual terms due to reduced cash flow, then national security will be compromised.

                         This rule will not cause long term harm to the defense industrial base or national security. Rather, DoD contractor competition and national security will be enhanced with the improvement of DoD contractors' business systems, and imminent cost savings that will result. Contractor business systems and internal controls are the first line of defense against waste, fraud, and abuse. Weak control systems increase the risk of unallowable and unreasonable costs on Government contracts, unnecessarily draining limited DoD resources at the taxpayers' expense.

According to the respondent, DCAA has not issued audit guidance to align its definition of significant deficiency to that in the NDAA and interim rule. DCAA's latest guidance in its MRD 08-PAS-011(R) dated March 2, 2008, starts out defining a significant deficiency as a &ldquo;potential unallowable cost that is not clearly immaterial.&rdquo; However, in MRD 08-PAS-043(R) dated December 19, 2008, DCAA clarified its guidance that &ldquo;DCAA only performs audits of contractor systems that are material to Government contract costs&rdquo; and that a contractor's &ldquo;failure to accomplish any applicable control objective should be reported as a significant deficiency/material weakness.&rdquo; The respondent stated that DCAA's clarification changes the criteria from a &ldquo;potential unallowable cost that is not clearly immaterial&rdquo; to if any deficiency is found during an audit, it is reported and the system is rated as inadequate. The respondent expressed concern that DCAA's guidance is constantly changing with no oversight body to regulate its audit policies.

The respondent suggested that such other protections might include: (1) Closer monitoring of payment requests submitted by the contractor in light of the noted deficiency; or (2) a decrement to certain, but not all, contract payments (or a withholding less than 5 percent) that might be more commensurate with the potential financial risk to the Government. The respondent further suggested that the final rule should clarify that the contracting officer must justify, in writing, the need to withhold against certain invoices based upon: (1) The nature of the particular system deficiency; (2) the perceived impact to the Government's reliability of information generated by such system due to the particular deficiency; (3) the nature of the invoices against which the withholdings will be applied and their correlation to the perceived risks associated with the specific system deficiency; and (4) the amount of withholding necessary to adequately protect the Government's interests due to the deficiency. The respondent suggested that requiring a written withholding determination will properly protect contractors from unreasonable or punitive withholdings that are unrelated to the system deficiency as well as ensure the withholdings are tailored to the Government's interests.

                         The intent of the rule is to authorize payment withholding when the contracting officer finds that there are one or more significant deficiencies due to the contractor's failure to meet one or more of the system criteria. The rule requires contracting officers to consider significant deficiencies in determining the adequacy of a contractor's business system and potential payment withholding in accordance with section 893 of the NDAA for FY 2011. Contract terms explicitly require contractors to maintain the business systems in question as a condition of contracting responsibility and, in some cases, eligibility for award. Contract prices are negotiated on the basis that contractors will maintain such systems, so that the Government does not need to maintain far more extensive inspection and audit functions than it already does. Failure of the contractor to maintain acceptable systems during contract performance deprives the Government of assurances for which it pays fair value. While not &ldquo;deliverable&rdquo; services under specific contract line items, the contractual requirements for the contractor business systems are material terms, performance of which is required to ensure contracts will be performed on time, within cost estimates, and with appropriate standards of quality and accountability. The payment withholding remedy provides a measure of the overall contract performance of which the Government is deprived during the performance period, and for which the contractor should not receive the full financing payments. DoD is relying on the temporary payment withholding amounts, not as a penalty for a deficiency, but as representing a good-faith estimate sufficient to mitigate the Government's risk where the actual amounts are difficult to estimate or quantify. Deficiencies that do not directly relate to unallowable or unreasonable costs still pose risks to the Government, and may lead to harm that may not be calculated readily when the deficiencies are discovered. In most cases, the financial impact of a system deficiency cannot be quantified because a deficient system produces unreliable information. When the financial impact of a deficiency is quantifiable, DoD expects contracting officers to take appropriate actions to reduce fees, recoup unallowable costs, or take legal action if fraudulent activity is involved.

The rule requires contracting officers to reduce withholding directly related to the significant deficiencies by at least 50 percent if, within 90 days of receipt of the contractor notification that the contractor has corrected the significant deficiencies, the contracting officer has not made a determination. This language is sufficient to mitigate a contractor's risk due to inaction by the Government.

                         A respondent stated that the interim rule establishes guidelines for contracting officers to determine when the provisions of the interim rule will become effective, and properly focuses on the treatment of existing solicitations and future contracts. However, the respondent expressed concern that the rule is silent on the treatment of pre-existing contracts that obviously do not include the contractor business systems clause. The respondent suggested that unless the contractor and the Government agree upon a bilateral modification, it would be improper for the contracting officer to modify unilaterally an existing contract that imposes such significant new obligations and potential liabilities on the contractor.

The respondent questioned whether these provisions are applicable to T&amp;M and firm-fixed-price (FFP) labor-hour contracts for commercial items.

                         The contracting officer is the only person with the authority to enter into, administer, and/or terminate contracts and make related determinations and findings.

When specialized expertise is required, contracting officers consult with auditors and other individuals with specialized experience, as necessary, to ensure a full understanding of issues. In fact, the rule requires such consultations. Accordingly, the contracting officer is the appropriate authority for making decisions regarding contractor business systems.

                         Section 893 of the NDAA for FY 2011 requires the Secretary of Defense to develop and initiate a program for the improvement of contractor business systems to ensure that such systems provide timely, reliable information for the management of DoD programs. Further, the statute sets forth that an appropriate official of the Department of Defense may withhold up to 10 percent of progress payments, performance-based payments, and interim payments under covered contracts from a covered contractor, as needed, to protect the interests of the Department and ensure compliance, if one or more of the contractor business systems has been disapproved. As a matter of policy, the DoD program that implements section 893 mandates withholds for significant deficiencies found in contractor business systems to protect DoD and the U.S. taxpayers from potential waste, fraud, and abuse, as allowed for in the statute.

                         An effective estimating system must gather and process information from other business systems outside the traditional estimating departmental functions. For example, a soundly functioning estimating department will find it necessary to obtain information about historical purchases from the accounting system to help form reliable estimates of prospective direct material purchases. System integration promotes consistency and prevents individual departments within a company from generating output without consideration of information available in other related business systems. Fair and reasonable estimates for future work must be reflective of the contractor organization as a whole, which requires a level of integration. An estimating system that is disconnected to the other contractor business systems is a reflection of poor internal controls.

The criteria for each business system defines the aspects of the system that materially affect the ability of DoD to rely on information produced. Determinations of significant deficiencies will be based on the contractor's failure to comply with the business system criteria. For example, the system criteria under the clause at DFARS 252.242-7006, Accounting System Administration, requires that the contractor's accounting system &ldquo;shall provide for * * * Accounting practices in accordance with standards promulgated by the Cost Accounting Standards Board, if applicable, otherwise, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.&rdquo; Each significant deficiency must be determined on its own set of facts regarding compliance with the system criteria.

                         The rule provides adequate opportunities for communication between the contracting officer and the contractor prior to the implementation of payment withholds. The contractor will be notified of a preliminary finding of a deficiency during the course of formal system reviews and audits. This occurs before the auditor or functional specialist releases a report to the contractor and contracting officer. After receiving a report, the contracting officer will promptly evaluate and issue an initial determination. The contractor is then allowed 30 days to respond to any significant deficiencies. Contractors are given ample opportunity to present their position during system reviews. Accordingly, the requirement for a contractor to respond within 30 days of an initial determination is adequate. The rule does not preclude the contracting officer from granting a contractor additional time to respond should that be requested and warranted.

For this reason, the contracting officer shall discontinue the withholding of payments, release any payments previously withheld, and approve the system only after the contracting officer determines that the contractor has corrected all significant deficiencies as directed by the contracting officer's final determination.

                         In accordance with the clause at DFARS 252.242-7005, Contractor Business Systems, a payment withhold is only applied to progress payments, performance-based payments, and interim payments under cost-reimbursement contracts, incentive type contracts, T&amp;M contracts, and labor-hour contracts. Payment withholding shall not apply to payments on fixed-price line items where performance is complete and the items were accepted by the Government. However, since contract line items under cost-reimbursement contracts are based on a contractor's actual costs and not on negotiated fixed prices, payment withholding will not be discontinued and previously withheld payments will not be released until the contract is completed, or all significant deficiencies have been corrected, whichever comes first.

A respondent recommended that the rule articulate this specific FAR/DFARS clause and define whose responsibility it is to both conduct the audit and ensure the performance of the audit. Paragraph (c)(17) of this clause requires the contractor to &ldquo;enforce&rdquo; certain Government policies for subcontracts. The respondent stated that prime contractors can flow down requirements or certify to certain attestations, or ensure to the best of their ability, but cannot enforce them with a subcontract.

According to the respondent, in such cases, the contracting officer should have the option not to withhold any amounts from billings; as it reads now, it is unclear that the contracting officer has this option. Furthermore, such language would encourage quicker resolution for correcting deficiencies that are not in dispute since it would encourage contractors to accelerate making changes even before the contracting officer issues an initial determination. The other remedies for significant deficiencies would continue as is. The respondent recommended adding optional language to the contracting officer's final determination that states &ldquo;the contractor's business system is acceptable and approved based upon the corrective actions already taken by the contractor.&rdquo;

If a significant deficiency is corrected by relatively simple means, and appropriate changes are made before the deficiency report is received by the contracting officer, DoD expects that the contracting officer would utilize sound business judgment in issuing initial and final determinations, and implementing payment withholds, if applicable.

                         One respondent recommended that when a contracting officer issues a final determination of a significant deficiency, the letter sent to the company should include language referring to the Contracts Disputes Act and what rights the contractor may have to appeal the contracting officer decision. According to the respondent, it is not clear that there is any appeal from the contracting officer's final decision, even though the decision may be completely in error. The respondent stated that the interim rule also does not address how such an appeal should be addressed by the contracting officer. It appears based on the Government comments to the interim rule that the Contracts Disputes Act of 1978 would apply to disputes over significant deficiencies in business systems. According to the respondent, it is not clear whether the final determination made by the contracting officer is subject to the appeals process outlined in FAR 33.211 or whether the contractor may have to certify and send a claim to the contracting officer to initiate the FAR part 33 process. The respondent suggested that this should be clarified in the final rule for the benefit of the Government and the contractors. Another respondent expressed concern that the appeals process in FAR 33.204 does not address the issue of the contracting officer having sole authority to implement the rule.

The interim rule indicates that a single significant deficiency in an EVMS guideline may result in withdrawal of EVMS approval for a company and subsequent implementation of the 5 percent payment withholding clause. The respondent stated that industry continues to maintain that this does not allow for tempering of findings based on risk, the degree of potential harm to the Government that could result from the identified deficiency, or any other factor that would indicate whether the deficiency is material in nature. The respondent suggested an incremental process for withholding of payments and withdrawal of EVMS system approval that takes materiality of deficiencies into consideration and incorporates DCMA's Corrective Action Request process and definitions for severity of findings of EVMS deficiencies.

                         All significant deficiencies pose risks to the Government and may lead to harm that may not be readily calculated when the deficiencies are discovered. The intent of the rule is to withhold payments when there is a shortcoming in the system that materially affects the ability of DoD officials to rely on information produced by the system for management purposes, i.e., significant deficiency. In the case of EVM, a disapproval would mean the system has one or more significant deficiencies due to the contractor's failure to comply with the system criteria in the clause at DFARS 252.234-7002, Earned Value Management System, and the contracting officer would be required to apply a withhold in accordance with the clause at DFARS 252.242-7005, Contractor Business Systems.

                         The rule provides adequate opportunities for communication between the contracting officer and the contractor prior to the implementation of payment withholds. The contractor will be notified of a preliminary finding of a deficiency during the course of formal systems reviews and audits. This occurs before the auditor or functional specialist releases a report to the contractor and contracting officer. After receiving a report, the contracting officer will promptly evaluate and issue an initial determination. The contractor is then allowed 30 days to respond to any significant deficiencies. Contractors are given ample opportunity to present their position during systems reviews.

                         Withholds are based on deficient business systems. A significant deficiency may result in the disapproval of multiple business systems resulting in a withhold applied against each system up to a maximum withhold of 10 percent per contract. Specific system criteria or requirements exist for each of the business systems. If a significant deficiency exists, then the ability to rely on information produced by the system is materially affected and the contracting officer is required to issue a final determination with a notice to withhold payments. There is a connection between the payment withhold and the business system. If similar significant deficiencies are determined to exist for multiple contractor business systems according to the published criteria for those systems, then a withhold could apply for each business system required under the contract.

Submission of a corrective action plan doesn't mean that the contractor has corrected all significant deficiencies identified in the final determination. Rather, the corrective action plan provides milestones and identifies actions that will eliminate the significant deficiencies. Until the contracting officer has evidence that the contractor has corrected the significant deficiencies, a payment withhold must remain in place in order to protect the interests of the Government.

                    <p id="p-130" data-page="11364">1. DFARS 215.407-5-70(d) is removed. The criteria for maintaining an acceptable estimating system have been relocated to the clause at 252.215-7002, Cost Estimating System Requirements. </p>
                    <p id="p-131" data-page="11364">2. DFARS 232.503-15 has been revised to correct the reference to the system criteria at DFARS 252.242-7004(d)(7). </p>
                    <p id="p-132" data-page="11364">3. DFARS 242.302(a)(4) has been deleted and an additional contract administration function to approve or disapprove contractor business systems has been added at DFARS 242.302(a)(S-74). </p>
                    <p id="p-133" data-page="11364">4. The term &ldquo;cost&rdquo; has been replaced by &ldquo;cost-reimbursement,&rdquo; as appropriate, in DFARS 242.7000(b)(1) and DFARS 252.242-7005(e). </p>
                    <p id="p-134" data-page="11364">5. The phrase &ldquo;and are expected to correct the significant deficiencies&rdquo; has been added to the end of DFARS 242.7000(d)(2) for clarity. </p>
                    <p id="p-135" data-page="11364">6. Under DFARS 242.7001, Contract clause, University Associated Research Centers (UARCs) has been added  to the list of entities to which the clause at DFARS 252.242-7005 does not apply. </p>
                    <p id="p-136" data-page="11364">7. DFARS 242.7502(g)(2)(ii) and (iv) are revised to remove specific examples of alternatives that contracting officers should consider to mitigate the risk of accounting system deficiencies on proposals where the deficiency impacts negotiations. These examples are removed so that contracting officers do not misinterpret these as being appropriate for mitigating all accounting system deficiencies. </p>
                    <p id="p-137" data-page="11364">8. The term &ldquo;cost or pricing data&rdquo; has been replaced by &ldquo;certified cost or pricing data,&rdquo; as appropriate, in DFARS 242.7502(g)(3)(ii), DFARS 244.305-70(f)(3)(ii), and DFARS 252.215-7002(c)(1) and (2). </p>

The clause at 252.242-7005, Contractor Business Systems, has been amended to clarify that the clause is applicable only to contracts awarded that are subject to Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), since a contracting officer is not likely to know if the resulting contract will be subject to CAS when drafting the solicitation. As a result, paragraphs (a) through (e) have been redesignated as (b) through (f). </p>
                    <p id="p-141" data-page="11364">12. The clause at DFARS 252.242-7005, Contractor Business Systems, has been amended to clarify the language regarding Contracting Officer determinations made based on the evidence submitted by the Contractor, that there is a reasonable expectation that the Contractor's corrective actions have been implemented and are expected to correct the significant deficiencies. Additionally, the clause language has been amended to require that Contracting Officers reduce withholding directly related to the significant deficiencies by at least 50 percent if, within 90 days of receipt of the Contractor notification that the Contractor has corrected the significant deficiencies, the Contracting Officer has not made a determination. In amending this clause, paragraph (f)(iii) has been added and former paragraphs (f)(iii) and (iv) have been redesignated as (f)(iv) and (v). </p>
                    <p id="p-142" data-page="11364">

                    <p id="p-144" data-page="11365">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993.

                    <p id="p-146" data-page="11365">The objective of the rule is to establish a definition for contractor business systems and implement compliance mechanisms to improve DoD oversight of those contractor business systems. The requirements of the rule will apply to solicitations and contracts that are subject to the Cost Accounting Standards under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1501" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. chapter 15</a>, as implemented in regulations found at <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-48/section-9903.201-1" class="cfr external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">48 CFR 9903.201-1</a> (see the FAR Appendix), other than in contracts with educational institutions, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers operated by educational institutions, or University Associated Research Centers, and include one or more of the defined contractor business systems. </p>
