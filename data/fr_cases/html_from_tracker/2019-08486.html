                    DoD published a proposed rule in the 
                    <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                     at <a href="/citation/83-FR-62554" class="fr-reference" data-reference="83 FR 62554">83 FR 62554</a> on December 4, 2018, to implement section 2804 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/115/public/232" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 115-232</a>). Section 2804 increases to $1 million the threshold at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2855" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2855</a> for small business set-asides of acquisitions for architect-engineer services, including construction design, in connection with military construction projects or military family housing projects. In addition, section 2804 removes the prohibition on setting aside these acquisitions valued above the threshold. As a result of these statutory changes, these acquisitions must be set aside for small business, if valued below $1 million, and may be set aside for small business, if valued at $1 million or more.
                </p>
                <p id="p-8" data-page="18160">There were no public comments submitted in response to the proposed rule.

                <p id="p-13" data-page="18160">DoD is issuing a final rule to amend the DFARS to implement section 2804 of the NDAA for FY 2019. Section 2804 increases to $1 million the threshold at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2855" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2855</a> for small business set-asides of acquisitions for architect-engineer services, including construction design, in connection with military construction projects or military family housing projects.

                    including construction design. Data from the Federal Procurement Data System shows that, during FY 2017 and FY 2018, DoD awarded an average of 229 contracts per year for architect-engineer services to an average of 190 unique small entities per year. In FY 2017 and FY 2018, DoD awarded approximately 30 contracts per year for architect-engineer services valued at more than the prior threshold of $400,000 and less than the new threshold of $1 million. This rule requires future contracts in this range to be awarded pursuant to FAR part 19 set-aside procedures. DoD also awarded approximately 284 contracts per year for architect-engineer services valued at more than $1 million. This rule makes it possible for future contracts at those dollar values to be awarded pursuant to FAR part 19 set-aside procedures. There are more than 27,000 small entities listed in Small Business Administration's Dynamic Small Business Search that provide architect-engineer services. Of these entities, approximately 270 could benefit from this rule.
