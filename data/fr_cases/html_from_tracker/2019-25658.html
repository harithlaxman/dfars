                <p id="p-15" data-page="65304">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     A respondent recommended that approval requests to use other than firm-fixed-price or fixed-price incentive contracts be included in the acquisition strategy, rather than in a separate approval document.
                </p>
                <p id="p-16" data-page="65304">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     This rule does not create a requirement for a separate approval document; rather, this rule instructs contracting officers to obtain HCA approval of their decision to use a cost-reimbursement type contract when the value of the contract is in excess of $25 million (on or after October 1, 2019). In accordance with FAR 7.105(b)(3), contracting officers are already required to include in an acquisition plan a discussion of the rationale for the selection of contract type, to include details regarding the complexity of the requirements and the associated reasoning essential to support the contract type selection. Departments and agencies have the latitude to establish the internal procedures for obtaining HCA approval of the use of cost-reimbursement contracts, which may include HCA approval of the acquisition plan.
                </p>
                <p id="p-17" data-page="65304">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     Respondents expressed concern with increased administrative burdens in the acquisition process, to include the timeliness of required approvals for contract type selection as a result of the rule. The respondents believed the rule will create difficulty for contracting officers when determining contract types based on risk.
                </p>
                <p id="p-18" data-page="65304">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The proposed rule implements the statutory requirement to obtain higher-level approval of the use of cost- reimbursement contracts at the specified thresholds. Section 829 of the NDAA for FY 2017 does not prohibit redelegation and FAR 1.102-4(b) authorizes decision making and the accountability for the decisions made to be delegated to the lowest level. As such, this rule delegates the section 829 approval authority to the head of the contracting activity, which should reduce any perceived impacts on administrative lead times. In addition, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (USD(A&amp;S)) has already determined that the use of cost-reimbursement contracts for research and development in excess of $25 million is approved, subject to a written determination by the contracting officer, as specified at DFARS 235.006(b)(i). This upfront approval should alleviate unnecessary burden associated with research and development contracts, which are frequently and appropriately awarded as cost-reimbursement contracts.
                </p>
                <h4 id="h-13">b. Contract Type Selection</h4>
                <p id="p-19" data-page="65304">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     A respondent expressed concerns that established programs may require cost-reimbursement and time-and-materials contracts when the program does not have a relevant or appropriate cost history, and that defense contractors use firm-fixed-price contracts to obtain high profits and do not disclose actual costs.
                </p>
                <p id="p-20" data-page="65304">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The proposed rule is consistent with DoD's current policies for the selection of contract type, which should balance risk fairly between the contractor and the Government, providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable profit/fee for successful delivery of products and services. Per DFARS 216.104, contracting officers are required to consider the principles and procedures in Director, Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy (DPAP) (now Defense Pricing and Contracting (DPC)), memorandum dated April 1, 2016, entitled &ldquo;Guidance on Using Incentive and Other Contract Types,&rdquo; when selecting and negotiating the most appropriate contract type for a given procurement. As stated in the memorandum, &ldquo;Profit should not be targeted as a cost-cutting measure, but should instead be reflective of actual performance, with higher profit levels tied to better performance and lower levels to poorer performance.&rdquo;

                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     A respondent expressed concern that section 829 of the NDAA for FY 2017 requirements permit risks to be placed on the contractor, rather than on the Government.
                </p>
                <p id="p-22" data-page="65305">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     Section 829 specifically established a preference for fixed-price contracts, including fixed-price incentive fee contracts, in the determination of contract type, and mandated approval of the use of cost-reimbursement contracts at established thresholds and time periods.
                </p>
                <p id="p-23" data-page="65305">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     A respondent was concerned that contracting officers would no longer have the flexibility during contract type determination to use tradeoffs (cost, schedule, and performance).
                </p>
                <p id="p-24" data-page="65305">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     DFARS 216.104, Factors in selecting contract type, requires contracting officers to follow the principles and procedures in the DPAP (now DPC) memorandum, &ldquo;Guidance on Using Incentive and Other Contract Types,&rdquo; dated April 1, 2016, when selecting and negotiating the most appropriate contract type for a given procurement. Section 829 requirements will in no way impede the requirement for contracting officers to consider the factors associated with cost, schedule, and performance, as required by FAR 16.104 in the determination of contract type.

                <p id="p-25" data-page="65305">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     A respondent recommended that all DoD approval requirements for incentive and award-fee contracts be located in the DFARS instead of the PGI for coherency.
                </p>
                <p id="p-26" data-page="65305">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     DoD agrees with the respondent's comment. In order to properly align with the FAR requirements for approval of the determination and findings for use of incentive- and award-fee contracts, the content of DFARS PGI 216.401(e)(iii) has been relocated to DFARS 216.401(d). The relocated text in DFARS 216.401(d) has been revised to reflect that approval of the HCA is required for cost-reimbursement incentive- or award-fee contracts valued in excess of $50 million or above to align with the section 829 implementation.

                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     A respondent recommended the waiver authority be revised to the Service Acquisition Executive, Combatant Commander, or USD(A&amp;S). The respondent also stated the Secretary of Defense justification delegating authority to the chief of contracting office should have been included in the proposed rule; to ensure only a DoD official appointed and confirmed by the Senate made the best interest determination applicable to the FMS.

                <p id="p-28" data-page="65305">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     FAR 1.102-4(b), authorizes decision making and the accountability for the decisions made to be delegated to the lowest level. Section 830 does not prohibit redelegation. Therefore, DoD has the discretion to delegate approval authority associated with section 830 waiver approval authority to the chief of the contracting office.

                <p id="p-29" data-page="65305">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     A respondent recommended deletion of DFARS 225.7301-2, which requires the contracting officer to coordinate through agency channels with the Principal Director of DPC prior to issuance of an FMS solicitation exceeding $500 million. The respondent expressed concern that the requirement created an extension of the peer review process, beyond service contracts in excess of $1 billion, without any statutory basis and without public comment.

                     The policy guidance at DFARS 225.7301-2 implements internal procedures for contracting officers negotiating sole source major system requirements for U.S. and U.S./FMS procurements contained in the DPAP (now DPC) policy memorandum, Negotiations of Sole Source Major Systems for U.S. and U.S/FMS Combined Procurements, dated June 28, 2018. Internal operating procedures of the Government are not subject to the requirements of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy statute (see section <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1707" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1707</a>).

                     This policy requirement implements section 830 and the DPAP (now DPC) policy memorandum, Negotiations of Sole Source Major Systems for U.S. and U.S./FMS Combined Procurements, dated June 28, 2018. This policy requirement is not applicable to all DoD procurements. Section 830 does not limit DoD's use of established defense acquisition regulations and procedures for FMS.

                    <em>Response:</em>
                     Section 830 specifically requires the use of firm-fixed-price contracts for FMS. This requirement may be waived if the chief of the contracting office determines, on a case-by-case basis, that a different contract type is in the best interest of the United States and American taxpayers.

                     The Letter of Offer and Acceptance facilitates the Government and the foreign country's agreement to specified terms and conditions on the FMS. Section 830 specifically requires the use of firm-fixed-price contracts for FMS unless an exception or a waiver applies.

                <p id="p-40" data-page="65305">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     Under FMS, the foreign customer is assured that the acquisition process will be subject to DoD standards through every step of the process. DoD standards dictate the defense acquisition system process, which includes the primary guiding principle that acquisitions must be in the best interest of the Government. In accordance with DFARS 225.7301(a) and (b), the Government sells defense articles and services to foreign governments or international organizations through FMS agreements and conducts FMS acquisitions under the same acquisition and contract management procedures used for other defense acquisitions. The agreement is documented in a Letter of Offer and Acceptance as required by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) Security Assistance Management Manual (DSCA 5105.38-M). Section 830 requirements will in no way impede the requirement for contracting officers to consider the factors associated with the FMS requirement process required by the defense acquisition system.

                    <em>Response:</em>
                     FMS procurements are funded using both foreign funds (which become appropriated funds when deposited into the Department of the Treasury) and appropriated funding for FMS requirements. In both instances they are considered Federal Government funds. This may also include funds expended for Government administrative costs associated with execution of the acquisition process. In accordance with FAR 1.102(d), Statement of guiding principles for the Federal Acquisition System, contracting officers are required to use sound business judgement as a member of the acquisition team to ensure decisions are made ensuring it is in the best interest of the Government, and ultimately the U.S. taxpayer. This rule does not remove the requirement for contracting officers to consider risk when determining the appropriate contract type for FMS. Inherently, a firm-fixed-price contract is used when the requirement is well defined, market conditions are stable, and when financial risks are otherwise insignificant; an example being commercial items. A cost-reimbursement contract is used when a requirement is unable to be adequately defined and uncertainty exists, increasing financial risks. Cost-reimbursement contracts may be used in research and development efforts, major system development, and prototype development, testing or low rate initial production efforts.

                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     A respondent stated that the use of fixed-price incentive contracts for FMS was not in line with the intent of Congress for section 830 of the NDAA for 2017.

                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The rule implements the section 830 requirement to use of firm-fixed-price contracts for foreign military sales, unless an exception or a waiver applies. The exception applies only if the foreign country (that is a counterparty to a foreign military sale) has established a preference for a different contract type or requests in writing that a different contract type be used for a specific FMS. The waiver is determined on a case-by-case basis that a different contract type is in the best interest of the United States and American taxpayers.

                     A respondent expressed concern that section 830 of the NDAA for 2017 permits risks to be placed on the contractor, rather than the Government.

                    <em>Response:</em>
                     Section 830 specifically requires the use of firm-fixed-price contracts for foreign military sales, unless an exception or a waiver applies. Inherently, a firm-fixed-price contract is used when the requirement is well defined, market conditions are stable, and when financial risks are otherwise insignificant. Typical use would be for commercial supplies and services. The contractor is required to provide an acceptable deliverable at the time, place, and total price specified in the contract.

Section 830 directs DoD to prescribe regulations requiring the use of firm-fixed-price (FFP) contracts for foreign military sales (FMS).</p>
                <p id="p-61" data-page="65306">The objective of the final rule is to implement the statutory requirements in section 829 and 830 of the NDAA for FY 2017 to: (1) Establish a preference for the use of fixed-price contracts in the determination of contract price; and (2) accelerate the contracting and pricing process of FMS by basing price reasonableness determinations on actual cost and pricing data for purchases of the same product for DoD.</p>
