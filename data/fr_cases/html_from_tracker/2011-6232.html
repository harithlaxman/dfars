Section 807 requires that facilities, infrastructure, and equipment that are intended for use by military or civilian personnel of the Department of Defense (DoD), in current or future military operations, should be inspected for safety and habitability prior to use, and that such facilities should be brought into compliance with generally accepted standards for the safety and health of personnel to the maximum extent practicable consistent with the requirements of military operations and the best interests of DoD to minimize the safety and health risk posed to such personnel.</p>

                <p id="p-7" data-page="14590">DoD published an interim rule at <a href="/citation/75-FR-66683" class="fr-reference" data-reference="75 FR 66683">75 FR 66683</a> on October 29, 2010, to implement section 807 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/111/public/84" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub.

</h2>
                <p id="p-12" data-page="14590">This rule is a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">Executive Order 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993.

                <h2 id="h-10">IV. Regulatory Flexibility Act</h2>
                <p id="p-14" data-page="14590">DoD has prepared a final regulatory flexibility analysis consistent with <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/604" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 604</a>. A copy of the analysis may be obtained from the point of contact specified herein. The analysis is summarized as follows:</p>
                <p id="p-15" data-page="14590">
                    The rule affects contractors with contracts, including task and delivery orders, in support of current and future military operations for construction, installation, repair, maintenance, or operation of facilities. This includes contracts for facilities, infrastructure, and equipment configured for occupancy, including but not limited to, existing host nation facilities, new construction, and relocatable buildings.

                </p>
                <p id="p-16" data-page="14591">Contracts will require compliance with the Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 1-200-01 to meet generally accepted standards for fire protection, structural integrity, electrical systems, plumbing, water treatment, waste disposal, and telecommunications networks. Facilities, infrastructure, and equipment shall be inspected prior to use to ensure safety and habitability.</p>
                <p id="p-17" data-page="14591">Military operations affected by this rule are those outside the United States, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.</p>
                <p id="p-18" data-page="14591">Contract support for recent military operations has been provided primarily by the Department of Army's LOGCAP contracts, which were awarded to large businesses. There are high costs associated with a company being able to perform in the geographic regions where most military operations are currently taking place. This makes it unlikely that a small business could afford to sustain the infrastructure required to perform these types of services in locations such as Iraq and Afghanistan. Small business preferential programs under FAR part 19 may not apply to these contracts as they only apply to contracts placed in the United States or its outlying areas. DoD invited comments when the interim rule was published on October 29, 2010 (<a href="/citation/75-FR-66683" class="fr-reference" data-reference="75 FR 66683">75 FR 66683</a>). No comments were received. Based on the above factors, the number of small business firms to which the rule would apply is expected to be minimal.</p>

                <p id="p-19" data-page="14591">The rule does not impose additional information collection requirements that require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/44/3501" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44 U.S.C. chapter 35</a>).</p>
