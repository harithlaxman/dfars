                    <p id="p-6" data-page="79000">
                        DoD published a proposed rule in the 
                        <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                         at <a href="/citation/89-FR-31680" class="fr-reference" data-reference="89 FR 31680">89 FR 31680</a> on April 25, 2024, to implement section 822 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/117/public/81" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 117-81</a>), which amends <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/4025" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 4025</a>. Section 822 provides the authority to carry out advanced technology prize programs to award contracts to recognize outstanding achievements in basic, advanced, and applied research; technology development; and prototype development. Section 822 specifies the award of a contract as a prize is a competitive procedure if the solicitation is widely advertised. Section 822 also requires approval of such awards that exceed $10,000 and congressional reporting for contracts that exceed $10 million. There were no public comments submitted in response to the proposed rule. There are no changes made to the final rule.
                    </p>
                    <h2 id="h-8">II. Applicability to Contracts At or Below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT), for Commercial Products (Including Commercially Available Off-the-Shelf (COTS) Items), and for Commercial Services</h2>
                    <p id="p-7" data-page="79000">This final rule does not create any new solicitation provisions or contract clauses. It does not impact any existing solicitation provisions or contract clauses or their applicability to contracts valued at or below the simplified acquisition threshold, for commercial products including COTS items, or for commercial services.</p>
                    <h2 id="h-9">III. Expected Impact of the Rule</h2>
                    <p id="p-8" data-page="79000">Prior to the enactment of the NDAA for FY 2022, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/4025" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 4025</a> (formerly <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2374a" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2374a</a>) did not provide for the award of contracts as prizes for outstanding achievements in basic, advanced, and applied research; technology development; and prototype development. This final rule implements the authority to award contracts as prizes under certain conditions.</p>
                    <p id="p-9" data-page="79000">This final rule may increase participation in prize competitions and decrease the lead time to deliver to the warfighter achievements in basic, advanced, and applied research; technology development; and prototype development. This final rule may help to expand the defense industrial base by providing a way for entities that are new to DoD procurement to obtain DoD contracts. It may also streamline the competitive process, which could reduce Government administrative costs associated with competitive negotiated acquisitions. For this reason, the difference in the cost of managing a contract instead of another type of prize is expected to be negligible.</p>

                        Data provided from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering indicates there were a total of 809 cash prizes awarded from FY 2021 to FY 2023, or approximately 270 per year, worth a total of about $3.5 million annually. DoD estimates 20 percent of these 270 historical cash prize awards, or 54 cash prize awards worth a total of approximately $700,000, would be converted to contracts. Therefore, DoD estimates that approximately 54 entities per year would be awarded contracts or a combination of contracts, other agreements (
                        <em>e.g.,</em>
                         grants, cooperative agreements, other transaction agreements), and cash prizes as a result of the changes in this final rule.

                    <p id="p-11" data-page="79000">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, as amended.</p>

A major rule under the Congressional Review Act cannot take effect until 60 days after it is published in the

Section 822 also requires approval of such awards exceeding $10,000 and congressional reporting for contracts exceeding $10 million. The objective of this final rule is to implement section 822 of the NDAA for FY 2022.</p>

                        total of 809 cash prizes awarded from FY 2021 to FY 2023, or approximately 270 per year, worth a total of about $3.5 million annually. During this three-year period, DoD awarded a total of 636 cash prizes to small entities, which is an average of 212 per year. DoD estimates 20 percent of these 212 historical cash prize awards, or 42 cash prize awards worth a total of approximately $545,000, would be converted to contracts. Therefore, DoD estimates that approximately 42 small entities per year would be awarded contracts or a combination of contracts, other agreements (

                         grants, cooperative agreements, other transaction agreements), and cash prizes as a result of the changes in this final rule. Therefore, DoD does not anticipate that this final rule will have a significant impact on small entities.
