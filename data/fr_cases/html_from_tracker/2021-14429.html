                    <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                     at <a href="/citation/79-FR-32522" class="fr-reference" data-reference="79 FR 32522">79 FR 32522</a> on June 5, 2014, to implement <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2330a" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2330a</a> (section 807 of the NDAA for FY 2008), which required DoD to establish a data collection system to provide certain data on the purchasing of services by DoD and to submit to Congress an annual inventory of services contracts awarded by or on behalf of DoD. The proposed rule for DFARS Case 2012-D051 required contractors to enter the required data into a DoD-unique system, Enterprise Contractor Manpower Reporting Application (ECMRA). In response to public comments received in response to the proposed rule for DFARS Case 2012-D051, DoD made the following changes in the proposed rule for DFARS Case 2018-D063:
                </p>
                
            <ul class="bullets" >
          <li id="p-8" data-page="36229">DoD has adopted the service contract reporting process used by other Federal agencies and no longer requires contractor reporting in ECMRA. This change enables DoD to use the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) to obtain a majority of the information required by<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2330a" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2330a</a>. FPDS does not provide data on the direct labor hours expended and dollar amounts invoiced for contracted services. Therefore, both the proposed and final rules require applicable contractors to enter the labor hours and dollar amounts in SAM, which is the process used by other Federal agencies, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 4.17.</li>
                <li id="p-9" data-page="36229">To relieve burden and minimize impact for contractors and subcontractors, both the proposed and final rules require contractors to report the total number of hours worked (both contractor and subcontractor) under the contract for the entire fiscal year and does not require a breakdown of those hours by employee type or by subcontractor. The requirement to report subcontractor data is limited to first-tier subcontractors, consistent with the FAR requirement for service contract reporting. The proposed and final rules leave the process for collecting subcontractor data up to the discretion of each contractor; the rules do not prescribe a specific methodology that contractors must use to gather this data on applicable subcontracts, or prescribe a reporting requirement for subcontractors via the flow-down of the contract clause.</li>

                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     Several respondents recommended that contracted services that meet the definition of commercial items be exempt from ECMRA reporting.
                </p>
                <p id="p-15" data-page="36230">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     An exception for services that meet the definition of a commercial item would exclude significant sums expended by DoD on commercial service acquisitions intended to be covered by the law. The intent of the statute is to enhance DoD's ability to manage the total force, inclusive of military, civilian, and contractor personnel. Specifically, section 2330a requires the military departments and defense agencies to ensure that the inventory of contracts for services required by the statute is used to inform strategic workforce planning decisions under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/129a" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 129a</a>, develop budget justification materials for services in accordance with <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/235" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 235</a>, and ensure services contracts are not for the performance of inherently governmental functions. Therefore, services meeting the definition of a commercial item are not exempt from the reporting requirement.

                     Several respondents recommended that firm fixed-price service contracts be exempt from the ECMRA reporting requirement, because these contracts acquire services in their entirety, not as individuals (full-time equivalents).

                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     One respondent recommended that the rule exempt DoD intelligence community agency contracts, because the existing exemption for &ldquo;classified services&rdquo; is not sufficient to cover the exempt contracts entered into by DoD intelligence community agencies.

                     The statute does not provide for exemptions to the reporting requirement; therefore, the proposed rule for DFARS Case 2012-D051 does not provide for exemptions, in order to comply with the law.

                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     One respondent recommended that, due to the difficulty in tracking labor for service contracts where contractor employees may spend only small fractions of their time servicing the Government contract (such as refuse collection and software as a service), the rule should be changed to exempt such contracts by using the criteria similar to the Service Contract Labor Standards exemptions (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1)).

                     Title 10 U.S.C. 2330a, as amended by section 812 of the NDAA for FY 2017, now limits data collection to four service acquisition portfolio groups: Logistics management services, equipment related services, knowledge-based services, and electronics and communications services. Under the proposed rule for DFARS Case 2018-D063, only service contracts with a total estimated value exceeding $3 million that are for services in one of the four portfolio groups must be reported in SAM.

                     One respondent questioned whether Congress intended DoD to report contracts for services that are integrally related to supplies, or contracts where the services are a relatively small dollar value in relation to the supplies.

                <p id="p-23" data-page="36230">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     Title 10 U.S.C. 2330a requires the collection of data on &ldquo;each purchase of services by a military department or Defense Agency&rdquo; that meets a certain dollar threshold and is for certain services. The proposed rule for DFARS Case 2018-D063 clarifies that the requirement applies to contracts or orders that have a total estimated value, including options, exceeding $3 million and are for services in one of the four service acquisition portfolio groups.

                <p id="p-24" data-page="36230">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     Two respondents suggested that the ECMRA reporting requirement be extended to contracts for services valued at or below the simplified acquisition threshold (SAT). Doing so would be consistent with the congressional intent in <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2330a" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2330a</a> for DoD to provide a total inventory of contracted services.

                <p id="p-25" data-page="36230">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     Title 10 U.S.C. 2330a(a), as amended by section 812 of the NDAA for FY 2017, now only requires the collection of data on service contracts, under certain portfolio groups, that exceed $3 million. The proposed rule for DFARS Case 2018-D063 implements the statutory threshold. Applying the rule to service contracts below $3 million is not necessary to implement the statute and would impose an unnecessary burden on the public and DoD.
                </p>

                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     One respondent suggested that the final rule clarify that services provided ancillary to a lease or rental contract (such as auto repair and maintenance services incidental to a vehicle lease) are subject to ECMRA reporting requirement. The respondent also recommended that the final rule clarify that the ECMRA reporting requirements apply to contracts for destruction, demolition, and removal.

                     Title 10 U.S.C. 2330a(a), as amended by section 812 of the NDAA for FY 2017, specifies that the service acquisition portfolio group for equipment related services is included in the required reporting group. It is expected that contracts for equipment-related services with a total estimated value, including options, exceeding $3 million will be reported in SAM.

                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     Two respondents indicated that the rule is duplicative of the existing FAR rule on service contract reporting that applies to civilian agencies (see FAR subpart 4.17). Respondents stated that there should not be two parallel systems, one for civilian agencies and another for defense agencies, because this situation causes confusion and compliance problems within industry.

                     Two respondents suggested that the requirement for subcontract reporting be changed. One respondent suggested that the prime contractor be required only to flow down the clause to subcontractors and relieved of the responsibility of reporting for subcontractors. The other respondent suggested that subcontractor data not be reported at all, as this is inconsistent with commercial practice.

                     The proposed rule for DFARS Case 2018-D063 does not contain a requirement to flow down a clause. Instead, the proposed rule requires contractors to include its subcontractor labor hours in the total number of labor hours the contractor reports annually to SAM. The proposed rule leaves the process for collecting subcontractor data up to the discretion of each contractor.

                     One respondent suggested that the Government reconsider whether this is a major rule. Title 5 U.S.C. 804 defines a major rule as one which the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) determines will cause a major increase in costs or prices for individual industries, or have a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment, productivity, or innovation. This rule imposes new reporting requirements, particularly for commercial item contractors that provide professional services and supplies. These contractors would not have been previously subject to the type of manpower reporting required by this rule. For small businesses, the need to build compliant procedures and automated systems could be a barrier to participating in the federal market. This is particularly the case when the cumulative effect of multiple and duplicative data reporting requirements is considered. The ultimate result over time will be a decrease in competition and innovation in the Federal market.

                     The burden applied to small businesses is the minimum consistent with applicable laws, Executive orders, regulations, and prudent business practices. The information collection requirement has been narrowly tailored to maximize the use of existing records already maintained by contractors and by the Government. To further minimize the impact, DoD is adopting the existing system and process used by the rest of the Government to obtain the requisite information from contractors, which maintains a familiar and consistent reporting requirement for contractors; and the information is collected electronically, help-desk support and user guides are available for SAM, and reporting requirements will be limited to a small number of data elements to facilitate ease of reporting and reduce contractor burden. In addition, the NDAA for FY 2017 raised the threshold for reporting to $3 million from the SAT and limited the data reporting to four service acquisition portfolio groups.

                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     Two respondents commented that the rule underestimates the number of contractors that will be impacted. One respondent indicated that the total estimated number of respondents of 13,269, including 7,962 for small businesses, seems low, since the GSA Schedules alone have 20,000 contractors and 80% of the contractors are small businesses. One respondent stated that the estimate for the total number of annual responses of approximately 54,000 appears low. In addition, several respondents commented that the estimate of an average of 1.4 hours per response is too low, citing reasons such as: (1) The billions of dollars in services for which DoD contracts for annually and the corresponding volume of data required to be entered, (2) the limitation of the ECMRA bulk upload capability, or (3) the impact on response time resulting from the flow down of the reporting requirement to subcontractors. One respondent stated that the burden is disproportionally high for small businesses that are less likely to have the necessary internal infrastructure.

                <p id="p-83" data-page="36233">No significant changes were made to the rule as a result of public comments. Minor changes were made to clarify the intent of the rule in regard to the requirement to report subcontract data. Public comments requested clarification on whether the rule required contractors to report direct labor hours and costs for all subcontracts that support the contract or just those subcontracts awarded to directly perform services under the contract, otherwise referred to as &ldquo;first-tier subcontracts&rdquo; under the similar service contract inventory reporting requirements at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 4.17. The intent of the rule is to require contractors to report the direct labor hours only for subcontracts the contractor directly awarded for the purpose of acquiring services for performance of the prime contract, similar to the subcontract reporting requirement at FAR 4.17. As a result, the term &ldquo;first-tier&rdquo; was added as a modifier to the definition of &ldquo;subcontract&rdquo; and a definition of &ldquo;first-tier subcontract&rdquo; was added to section 204.1701 and DFARS clause 252.204-7023, Reporting Requirements for Contracted Services, and its alternate I.</p>

                     Two respondents recommended that commercial service contracts be exempt from the rule, as companies providing commercial services may not have a system to track labor hours by contract and/or by subcontractor and may need to implement a new system to comply with the rule.

                     The statute requires DoD to collect data on specific service purchases in excess of $3 million, regardless of contract type, and does not provide for exemptions to the reporting requirement.

                     A respondent advised that the rule weakens the utility of service contract inventories by limiting them to staff augmentation contracts and contracts closely associated with inherently governmental functions, and preventing the adoption of the Enterprise-wide Contractor Manpower Reporting Application (ECMRA).

                     The rule implements the statute and supports DoD total workforce management efforts by requiring reporting on contracts valued in excess of $3 million for logistics management services, equipment-related services, knowledge-based services, or electronics and communications services. The rule does not further limit the reporting requirement to only those contracts that are also staff augmentation contracts or contracts for services closely associated with inherently governmental functions.

                     The rule requires the collection of data that supplements information already available to DoD. The rule assists in the evaluation of DoD's workforce mix and the extent to which the Department's needs are being met through contracted support. It is not necessary to distinguish between the contractor and subcontractor labor hours performed under a contract in order to meet the requirements of the statute or support DoD's total workforce management efforts.

                     The rule implements the reporting cycle required by <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2330a" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2330a</a>. The statute requires DoD, by the end of the third quarter of each fiscal year, to prepare an annual inventory of the activities performed during the preceding fiscal year pursuant to staff augmentation contracts and contracts closely associated with inherently governmental functions. To support this requirement, the rule requires contractors to input contract data for the preceding fiscal year in SAM no later than October 31 of each fiscal year.

                <p id="p-96" data-page="36234">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     Two respondents advised that the reporting requirement of the rule may be difficult to meet, because many commercial services are offered at a fixed price and are not broken down into direct labor hours, and subcontractors may consider the data sensitive or proprietary and be hesitant to provide it to contractors. A respondent advised that, as a result of these issues, the rule may create cost and competition implications for the supply chain because contractors may have to create and price contractual requirements to obtain the information from their subcontractors, and the number of available vendors may be restricted if they choose not to provide the data required by the rule.

                <p id="p-97" data-page="36234">As an alternative solution, two respondents recommended that the rule limit the collection of data to the list explicitly identified at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2330a" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2330a(b)</a>.

                     The statute requires that &ldquo;the number of contractor employees, expressed as full-time equivalents for direct labor, using direct labor hours and associated cost data collected from contractors&rdquo; be provided for each contract included in the annual inventory. This information is not included in the list of data at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2330a" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2330a(b)</a>.

                <p id="p-99" data-page="36234">While the Federal Procurement Data System provides DoD with a majority of the requisite data, DoD cannot meet all of the statutory data requirements of the inventory summary, or support the needs of DoD's total workforce management efforts, using only the data listed at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2330a" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2330a(b)</a>.

                     Concur. To reduce burden on and maintain consistency for contractors, DoD intends for the reporting requirements and procedures of this rule to be as similar as possible to the existing service contract reporting requirements of the FAR. The intent of the rule is for contractors to report the total number of direct labor hours expended in performing the contracted services during the preceding fiscal year. The total number of hours reported to SAM should represent a combined total of the number of direct labor hours the contractor itself expended performing the contracted services, and the total number of direct labor hours any of the contractor's subcontractors expended performing the contracted services. To clarify this intent, the rule is amended to replace the term &ldquo;subcontract&rdquo; with &ldquo;first-tier subcontract,&rdquo; based on the definition at FAR 4.1701.

                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The rule simply requires the reporting of the direct labor hours expended on the contracted service for the preceding fiscal year. The rule does not prescribe or suggest a specific methodology that contractors must use to gather this data on its applicable subcontracts, or prescribe a reporting requirement for subcontractors via the flow-down of the contract clause. Therefore, an amendment to the rule to authorize a specific methodology for gathering the data is not necessary.

                <p id="p-117" data-page="36235">
                    A final regulatory flexibility analysis (FRFA) has been prepared consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>, 
                    <em>et seq.</em>
                     The FRFA is summarized as follows:
                </p>
                <p id="p-118" data-page="36235">The objective of this rule is to implement <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2330a" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2330a</a>, as modified by section 812 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/114/public/328" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 114-328</a>), which requires DoD to establish a data collection system that provides management information on each purchase of services by a military department or defense agency in excess of $3 million for the following service acquisition portfolio groups: Logistics management services; equipment-related services; knowledge-based services; and electronics and communications services.</p>
                <p id="p-119" data-page="36235">As a result, DoD is amending the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) to require contractors to annually report certain data on applicable contracts in order to meet the data requirements of the statute and DoD's total workforce management efforts. No public comments were received in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis.</p>
                <p id="p-120" data-page="36235">Based on data from the Federal Procurement Data System for FY 2016 through 2018, DoD awards annually an average of 4,386 service contracts and orders to 1,934 unique entities that have an estimated value greater than $3 million and are within the four portfolio groups outlined in the rule. Of the 4,386 contracts and orders awarded annually, approximately 2,059 (47 percent) are made to 1,227 (63 percent) unique small entities.</p>
                <p id="p-121" data-page="36235">This rule requires all contractors that are awarded a contract or order in excess of $3 million for services in any of the four service acquisition portfolio groups to report contract data in the System for Award Management (SAM). The contractor is required to report the total amount invoiced for services performed during the preceding fiscal year and the number of direct labor hours, including first-tier subcontractor hours, expended on services performed during the preceding fiscal year. The Government estimates that a journeyman level contractor employee with basic knowledge of the contract would be required to enter the data. The contractor employee may also need to gather additional billing information from the organization in order to complete the data input in SAM.</p>
                <p id="p-122" data-page="36235">While this rule does not impose a significant economic impact on small entities, DoD has taken steps to minimize the impact of the rule on both small and large entities. Specifically, DoD now requires reporting under the rule to be done in SAM, instead of the Enterprise-wide Contractor Manpower Reporting Application (ECMRA). This change permits contractors to report fewer data elements under the rule and implements a data collection system that is familiar to contractors under the existing service contract reporting requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.</p>

                <p id="p-123" data-page="36235">This rule contains information collection requirements that have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/44/3501" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44 U.S.C. chapter 35</a>).
