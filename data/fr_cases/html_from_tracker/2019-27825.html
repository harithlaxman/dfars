                     Multiple respondents expressed support for the statute and strong implementation of the statute in the interim rule. One respondent stated support for DoD's efforts to promulgate a strong rule that will support a robust and healthy domestic industrial base, because a strong national strategic materials industry is important to national security. This respondent also supported speedy implementation of a final rule. Another respondent noted that the interim rule will shield U.S. critical resource needs from the decisions of foreign adversaries.

                <p id="p-25" data-page="72240">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     Most respondents welcomed the use of procedures from the specialty metals regulations, to the extent that the laws are comparable. One respondent stated that this will generally support quick and fair implementation of the law. According to this respondent, because the new statute at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2533c" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2533c</a> closely mirrors the language on specialty metals at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2533b" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2533b</a>, the interim rule appropriately uses the procedures from the specialty metals clause, and will be better in implementation for it, because use of existing procedures minimizes adjustments for suppliers and for DoD. This respondent also stated that DoD should recognize that Congress's intent was for the two laws to operate in a complementary fashion.
                </p>
                <p id="p-26" data-page="72240">Several respondents recommended defining the term &ldquo;produce&rdquo; more in line with the definition of &ldquo;produce&rdquo; from the specialty metals clause (see discussion at section 3.).</p>
                <p id="p-27" data-page="72240">One respondent was of the opinion that this interim rule conflicts with other Federal rules, because samarium-cobalt magnets are already controlled by the specialty metals statute, and this rule established new restrictions for samarium-cobalt magnets for contractors that already comply with specialty metals requirements. According to this respondent, the statute and implementing regulations set in place new and contradictory prohibitions for those critical magnets that may have undesirable and unintended consequences.</p>
                <p id="p-28" data-page="72240">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     To the extent that the new statute parallels the specialty metals statute, it makes sense to implement the statute in a way that is comparable.
                </p>
                <p id="p-29" data-page="72240">
                    To the extent that the new statute imposes new restrictions on samarium-cobalt magnets, those restrictions must be applied in a way that harmonizes with the specialty metals restrictions, while fully implementing the new statute. There are other instances of overlapping restrictions (
                    <em>e.g.,</em>
                     ball and roller bearings may be made from specialty metals), in which case a cross-reference is included to remind affected parties of the need to comply with both sets of restrictions (see DFARS 225.7009-2(b) and 252.226-7016(e)). A similar cross-reference to the specialty metal restrictions was included in the interim rule at DFARS 225.7018-2(c) (now 225.7018-2(b)(2)) and DFARS 252.225-7052(b)(3) (now 252.225-7052(b)(2)(ii)). This rule also reformats the explanation of the term &ldquo;required form&rdquo; for specialty metals and provides a new explanation as to the meaning of &ldquo;required form&rdquo; when applied to magnets. In addition, some pointers to the DFARS PGI have been added to provide additional guidance on the interrelationship of certain exceptions to the specialty metals restrictions on samarium-cobalt magnets in <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2033b" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2033b</a> and the new restrictions on samarium-cobalt magnets in <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2533c" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2533c</a>.

                    <em>Comment:</em>

                     Samarium-cobalt magnets are covered by both <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2533b" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2533b</a> (specialty metals) and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2533c" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2533c</a>, implemented under this rule. <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2533c" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2533c</a> applies specific separate prohibitions to samarium cobalt magnets, which must be harmonized with the restrictions of <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2533b" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2533b</a>. The specialty metals statute is generally more stringent than <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2533c" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2533c</a>, requiring melt or production in the United States or a qualifying country, rather than just prohibiting melt or production in certain covered countries (North Korea, China, Russia, and Iran). However, if an exception to <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2533b" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2533b</a>, such as nonavailability from the United States or a qualifying country, applies, then the requirement to not buy a samarium-cobalt magnet melted or produced in a covered country remains in effect, unless a magnet melted or produced in any country except a covered country is also nonavailable.

                <p id="p-36" data-page="72240">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     DoD has added a definition of &ldquo;tungsten heavy alloy&rdquo; so that it is clear whether a particular tungsten product is subject to the restrictions of <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2033c" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2033c</a>. In this final rule, &ldquo;tungsten heavy alloy&rdquo; is defined at DFARS 225.7018-1 and the associated clause at DFARS 252.225-7052. The definition recognizes two standards for specific classes of tungsten heavy alloy: ASTM B777 and SAE-AMS-T-2104. However, the definition also recognizes that there may be variants of tungsten heavy alloy that do not meet one of the standards for a specified class of tungsten heavy alloy, but are nevertheless in the tungsten heavy alloy family if the material contains at least 90 percent tungsten, combined with other metals such as nickel-iron or nickel-copper, and has a density of at least 16.5 g/cm3.

                     Several respondents noted that the rule did not address the production process for tungsten. One respondent provided further details with regard to production of tungsten. According to the respondent, tungsten metal powder and tungsten heavy alloy are not manufactured through a melting process, but through production processes in which the dissolution/digestion process of converting tungsten ore and ammonium paratungstate into refined tungsten powder are the key, value added &ldquo;melt-equivalent&rdquo; steps. Therefore, the respondent suggested defining &ldquo;produce&rdquo; for tungsten (similar to the definition in the specialty metals clause) as (i) atomization; (ii) calcination and reduction into powder; or (iii) final consolidation of non-melt derived metal powders.

                     One respondent considered the nonavailability determination process in the interim rule to be workable and appropriate. According to this respondent, DoD has struck a smart balance in determining the officials that can issue a nonavailability determination.

According to this respondent, limiting authority to grant individual determinations to five officials other than the Secretary of Defense and limiting the class nonavailability determination to one additional official is unwarranted and will grind the acquisition process to a halt. This respondent recommended that the Secretary of Defense make a nonavailability determination that applies to all DoD procurements, or grant contracting officers the authority to make nonavailability determinations, with both options relying on Federal Government studies and reports to date. This respondent was of the opinion that DoD does not have to immediately cut off the supply chain of critical minerals and cause major disruptions.</p>

                    <em>Response:</em>
                     In this final rule, DoD has made the head of the contracting activity the approving official at DFARS 225.7018-4(a) for individual nonavailability determinations, and does not limit further redelegation of this authority. However, USD(A&amp;S)DASD for Industrial Policy still requires a copy of each individual nonavailability determination with supporting documentation and notification when individual waivers are requested, but denied. Because of the significant impact that a class determination of nonavailability may have, DoD has retained accountability at the USA(A&amp;S) level and has made no changes to the requirements of the interim rule at DFARS 225.7018-4(b).

                    <em>Response:</em>
                     There are currently many source restrictions that allow an exception for nonavailability (such as the Buy American statute, the Berry Amendment at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2533a" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2533a</a>, the specialty metal restrictions at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2533b" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2533b</a>, and various appropriations act domestic source restrictions). This determination is not substantively different. As specified at DFARS 225.7018-3(d), the restriction does not apply if the authorized agency official concerned determines that &ldquo;compliant covered materials of satisfactory quality and quantity, in the required form, cannot be procured as and when needed at a reasonable price.&rdquo; Any entity seeking a nonavailability determination must provide the Government with sufficient data and a rationale to justify such a determination.

                <p id="p-83" data-page="72242">
                    A final regulatory flexibility analysis (FRFA) has been prepared consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>, 
                    <em>et seq.</em>
                     The FRFA is summarized as follows: This rule is required to implement section 871 of the National Defense Authorization act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2019, which is codified at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2533c" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2533c</a>. The objective of the rule is to prohibit acquisition of sensitive materials (
                    <em>i.e.</em>
                     samarium-cobalt magnets, neodymium-iron-boron magnets, tungsten metal powder, and tungsten heavy alloy or any finished or semi-finished components containing tungsten heavy alloy melted or produced in North Korea, China, Russia, or Iran).

                <p id="p-84" data-page="72242">One respondent had several comments in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis.</p>
                <p id="p-85" data-page="72242">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     The respondent noted that the statement that &ldquo;DoD expects there will be some adjustment period as U.S. and other non-prohibited sources comes on line&rdquo; ignores the obvious significant risk of disruption this new prohibition will cause DoD and its suppliers.
                </p>
                <p id="p-86" data-page="72242">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The IRFA acknowledged that there will be an adjustment period. There is, however, an exception for nonavailability, which may initially be utilized until more non-prohibited sources become available. The final rule has also facilitated nonavailability determinations by reducing the approval level for individual determinations to the head of the contracting activity, with power of redelegation.

                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The rule does not impose any specific reporting or recordkeeping requirements. It does not specify what records must be kept, or for how long. It is up to the Contractor how to track compliance with the rule, without any additional recordkeeping requirements imposed by the Government.

                     According to the respondent, the rule conflicts with other Federal rules.

                    <em>Response:</em>
                     As stated in the response in section 1.c., the fact that two statutes, and the regulations implementing them, apply different restrictions to the same item does not create a conflict. Rather, the overlapping restrictions must be applied together in harmony, so that, in any given circumstance, the effective requirements can be determined.
                </p>
                <p id="p-91" data-page="72243">Based on Federal Procurement Data System data for FY 2017, DoD awarded in the United States 13,400 contracts that exceeded $250,000 and were for the acquisition of manufactured end products (excluding those categories that could not include samarium-cobalt magnets, neodymium-iron-boron magnets, or a covered form of tungsten (such as clothing and fabrics, books, or lumber products)). These contracts were awarded to 5,073 unique entities, of which 3,074 were small entities. It is not known what percentage of these awards involved samarium-cobalt magnets, neodymium-iron-boron magnets, or a covered form of tungsten, or what lesser percentage might involve such materials from China, North Korea, Russia, or Iran.</p>
                <p id="p-92" data-page="72243">As discussed above, there are no projected reporting or recordkeeping requirements in this rule. However, based on this rule, there may be compliance costs to track the origin of covered materials.</p>
