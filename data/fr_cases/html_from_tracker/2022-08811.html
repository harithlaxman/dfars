                <p id="p-7" data-page="25148">
                    DoD published a proposed rule in the 
                    <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                     at <a href="/citation/85-FR-53755" class="fr-reference" data-reference="85 FR 53755">85 FR 53755</a> on August 31, 2020, to implement section 865 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/115/public/232" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 115-232</a>), which repeals several years of congressional adjustments to the statutory presumption of development at private expense for commercial items in the validation procedures at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2321" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paragraph (f) of 10 U.S.C. 2321</a>. The DFARS implementation of this mandatory presumption has evolved accordingly to track the statutory changes, with the primary coverage found at paragraph (c) of section 227.7103-13, and paragraph (b) of the contract clause at 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data. One respondent submitted written public comments in response to the proposed rule.
                </p>
                <h2 id="h-8">II. Discussion and Analysis</h2>
                <p id="p-8" data-page="25148">DoD reviewed the public comments submitted in writing and discussed by the attendees at the virtual public meeting on November 19, 2020, in the development of the final rule. A discussion of the comments and the changes made to the rule as a result of those comments is provided, as follows:</p>
                <h3 id="h-9">A. Summary of Significant Changes From the Proposed Rule</h3>
                <p id="p-9" data-page="25148">Based on comments received, language was added to DFARS 227.7103-13(c) and DFARS 252.227-7037(e) to indicate the information that supports the challenge notice must be included in the challenge notice, subject to handling procedures for classified information or controlled unclassified information (CUI).</p>
                <h3 id="h-10">B. Analysis of Public Comments</h3>
                <h4 id="h-11">1. DoD Must Provide Sufficient Information To Support the Challenge Notice</h4>
                <p id="p-10" data-page="25148">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     The respondent requested elimination of the phrase &ldquo;to the maximum extent practicable&rdquo; in the proposed revisions to DFARS 227.7103-13(c)(2) and DFARS 252.227-7037(e)(1)(i) and (f) because this phrase does not appear in the underlying statute. The respondent asserted that this language introduces uncertainty as to whether and when the contracting officer must provide sufficient information to overcome the presumption. The respondent asserted that the Government should furnish CUI in the manner in which the Government conventionally furnishes other CUI to contractors. If classified information cannot be provided with the challenge notice in an unclassified communication, then the classified information may be contemporaneously furnished via alternate means that complies with the applicable security requirements.
                </p>
                <p id="p-11" data-page="25148">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     DoD adopted the respondent's recommendation to remove the phase &ldquo;to the maximum extent practicable.&rdquo; In view of the respondent's comments, the rule has also been revised to indicate that the challenge notice will include sufficient information to reasonably demonstrate that a commercial item was not developed exclusively at private expense, subject to the handling procedures for classified information and controlled unclassified information. Such handling procedures may include, but are not limited to, contemporaneous communications (referenced in the challenge notice) that consist of classified information transmitted via secured channels.

                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     The respondent recommended that, because section 865 repealed several congressional amendments to the statutory presumption of development exclusively at private expense, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2320" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2320</a> and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2321" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2321</a> should be included in the DFARS 212.504 exclusionary list of statutes that are inapplicable to contracts and subcontracts for the acquisition of commercial items. The respondent also recommended removing the mandatory flowdown requirements in the contract clauses at DFARS 252.227-7013, 252.227-7015, and 252.227-7037.

                <p id="p-14" data-page="25148">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     The respondent recommended elimination of mandatory flowdown language in the clauses at DFARS 252.227-7037(l), 252.227-7013(k)(2), and 252.227-7015(e), which require contractors to use the clauses in other contractual instruments for commercial items with suppliers at any tier if the other contractual instruments require the delivery of technical data. The respondent asserted that this mandatory flowdown is both inconsistent with the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (FASA) and undermines DoD's efforts to acquire commercial items.

                <h4 id="h-14">4. DFARS 252.227-7013 Should Not Apply to Commercial Items With &ldquo;Of a Type&rdquo; or &ldquo;Minor&rdquo; Modifications</h4>
                <p id="p-16" data-page="25149">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     The respondent noted that the current DFARS policy permits use of both DFARS clauses at 252.227-7013 (for technical data related to noncommercial and commercial technology developed with Government funds) and 252.227-7015 (for technical data related to commercial technology developed at private expense). The respondent expressed concern that this paradigm creates a complicated mix of commercial and noncommercial terms along with potentially costly portion-marking. The respondent also asserted that these rules may discourage companies from selling modified commercial items to the Government. The respondent recommended that the noncommercial technical data rights clause at DFARS 252.227-7013 should not apply to commercial items with &ldquo;of a type&rdquo; or &ldquo;minor&rdquo; modifications. The respondent stated that DFARS 252.227-7037 and the associated prescriptive guidance should be revised to clarify that Government funds used to modify a commercial item shall not be used as the basis for rebutting the presumption of development exclusively at private expense so long as the modified item continues to meet the commercial item definition at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 2.101. The respondent also suggested revising DFARS 252.227-7013, 252.227-7015, and the associated guidance for contracting officers to clarify that 252.227-7013 shall not apply to commercial items modified at Government expense so long as the modified item continues to meet the commercial item definition at FAR 2.101.

                <p id="p-18" data-page="25149">Minor editorial changes are made in DFARS clause 252.227-7037 to the expressed time periods to conform to standard rule drafting conventions.</p>
                <h2 id="h-16">III. Applicability to Contracts at or Below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold, for Commercial Products (Including Commercially Available Off-the-Shelf Items), and for Commercial Services</h2>
                <p id="p-19" data-page="25149">This rule amends the contract clause at 252.227-7037 and the prescription at DFARS 227.7103-13. However, this rule does not impose any new requirements on contracts at or below the simplified acquisition threshold (SAT), for commercial products (including commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) items), or for commercial services. The prescription and clause will continue to apply to acquisitions at or below the SAT and to acquisitions of commercial products (including COTS items).</p>
                <h3 id="h-17">A. Applicability to Contracts at or Below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold</h3>
                <p id="p-20" data-page="25149"><a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1905" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1905</a> governs the applicability of laws to contracts or subcontracts in amounts not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold. It is intended to limit the applicability of laws to such contracts or subcontracts. <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1905" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1905</a> provides that if a provision of law contains criminal or civil penalties, or if the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council makes a written determination that it is not in the best interest of the Federal Government to exempt contracts or subcontracts at or below the SAT, the law will apply to them. The Principal Director, Defense Pricing and Contracting (DPC), is the appropriate authority to make comparable determinations for regulations to be published in the DFARS, which is part of the FAR system of regulations. DoD has made that determination. Therefore, this rule does apply to contracts at or below the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>
                <h3 id="h-18">B. Applicability to Contracts for the Acquisition of Commercial Products (Including COTS Items) and Commercial Services</h3>
                <p id="p-21" data-page="25149"><a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2375" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2375</a> governs the applicability of laws to contracts and subcontracts for the acquisition of commercial products (including COTS items) and commercial services and is intended to limit the applicability of laws to contracts for the acquisition of commercial products (including COTS items) and commercial services. <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2375" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2375</a> provides that if a provision of law contains criminal or civil penalties, or if the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (USD(A&amp;S)) makes a written determination that it is not in the best interest of the Federal Government to exempt commercial product or commercial service contracts, the provision of law will apply to contracts for the acquisition of commercial products or commercial services.</p>
                <p id="p-22" data-page="25149">Due to delegations of authority from USD(A&amp;S), the Principal Director, DPC, is the appropriate authority to make this determination.

                <p id="p-23" data-page="25149">
                    This rule implements statutory requirements regarding the presumption of development at private expense for commercial products (including COTS items) in validations of asserted restrictions. Not applying the rule to contracts at or below the SAT would exclude contracts at low dollar values for commercial products intended to be covered by this rule. An exclusion for contracts at or below the SAT would therefore undermine the overarching purpose of the rule. Therefore, DoD has determined that it is in the best interest of the Federal Government to apply the rule to contracts valued at or below the SAT.

                </p>
                <p id="p-24" data-page="25150">Given that the requirements of section 865 of the NDAA for FY 2019 were enacted to return to a presumption of development exclusively at private expense for commercial products, DoD has determined that it is in the best interest of the Federal Government to apply the rule to contracts for the acquisition of commercial products, including COTS items, as those terms are defined at FAR 2.101. An exception for contracts for the acquisition of commercial products, including COTS items, would exclude contracts intended to be covered by the law, thereby undermining the overarching public policy purpose of the law.</p>
                <h2 id="h-20">IV. Expected Impact of the Rule</h2>
                <p id="p-25" data-page="25150">The final rule applies the statutory requirements regarding the presumption of development at private expense for commercial items in validations of asserted restrictions. Specifically, the rule returns the coverage at DFARS 227.7103-13 and 252.227-7037 substantially back to the original Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act-implementing language with regard to the presumption of development exclusively at private expense for commercial items. This statutory change places the burden of proof on DoD, not on the contractor or subcontractor, for commercial items.</p>
                <p id="p-26" data-page="25150">Under the new rule, DoD is required to presume that the contractor or subcontractor has justified the asserted restriction on the basis that the item was developed exclusively at private expense for commercial items, regardless of whether the contractor or subcontractor submits a justification in response to the Government's challenge notice. In such a case, the challenge to the use or release restriction may be sustained only if information provided by DoD demonstrates that the item was not developed exclusively at private expense. Within the validation procedures, the presumption of development at private expense for commercial items is primarily designed to protect the contractors' interests.</p>
                <p id="p-27" data-page="25150">The impact of these changes may be positive, for both the public and the Government, because the Government will not initiate challenges when it does not have sufficient information to support the initiation of a challenge. Contractors will not be required to respond to challenges or pre-challenge requests for information regarding commercial items. Therefore, if DoD does not have information demonstrating that a commercial item was not developed exclusively at private expense, a contracting officer may reasonably decide not to initiate a challenge. DoD does not have data on the number of challenges that may be avoided.</p>
                <p id="p-28" data-page="25150">If DoD does not have sufficient information to successfully initiate a challenge to a contractor's restrictive markings on technical data for commercial items, DoD will have to comply with those restrictive markings. Such information may exist but be in the custody and control of the contractor. For contractors, the impact may be positive, as it would limit how DoD could use technical data related to a contractor's commercial item. For the Government, the markings may impact DoD's ability to use the technical data to obtain competitive procurement of an item and thus result in higher costs.

                    DoD is proposing to implement section 865 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/115/public/232" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 115-232</a>), which revised <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2321" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2321</a>. Section 865 of the NDAA for FY 2019 repeals amendments to <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2321" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2321(f)</a> made by the NDAAs for FY 2007 through FY 2016. The impact is to return the DFARS coverage at section 227.7103-13 and the contract clause at 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data, substantially back to its original language implementing the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994. Section 865 also codifies and revises DoD challenges to contractor-asserted restrictions on technical data pertaining to a commercial item, 
                    <em>i.e.,</em>
                     DoD is required to presume that the contractor or subcontractor has justified the asserted restriction on the basis that the item was developed exclusively at private expense, regardless of whether the contractor or subcontractor submits a justification in response to the Government's challenge notice. In such a case, the challenge to the use or release restriction may be sustained only if information provided by DoD demonstrates that the item was not developed exclusively at private expense.

Based on data from Electronic Data Access for FY 2018 through FY 2020, DoD estimates that an average of 814 contractors may be impacted by the changes in this final rule.
