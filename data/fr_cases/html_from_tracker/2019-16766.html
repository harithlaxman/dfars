                    DoD published a proposed rule in the 
                    <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                     at <a href="/citation/84-FR-4429" class="fr-reference" data-reference="84 FR 4429">84 FR 4429</a> on February 15, 2019, to implement section 811 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 and section 815 of the NDAA for FY 2018. Section 811 modifies restrictions on undefinitized contractual actions (UCA) regarding risk-based profit, time for definitization, and Foreign Military Sales. Section 815 establishes limitations on unilateral definitizations of UCAs over $50 million. Three respondents provided public comments in response to the proposed rule.

                <p id="p-8" data-page="39204">There are changes to the definition of &ldquo;qualifying proposal&rdquo; at 217.7401 as a result of public comments. In addition, DoD has delegated some authorities to the head of the contracting activity.</p>

                <h4 id="h-11">1. Support for the Rule</h4>
                <p id="p-9" data-page="39204">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     One respondent stated unqualified support for the rule.

                <h4 id="h-12">2. Timely Definitization</h4>
                <p id="p-11" data-page="39204">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     One respondent indicated that the proposed rule impedes the ability of contracting officers to definitize UCAs timely and recommended that the rule be rescinded. The respondent asserted that the application of a higher profit factor after receipt of the qualifying proposal but prior to definitization of the UCA encourages contractors to stall until after the 180-day window has closed, since most contractors are motivated by profit.
                </p>
                <p id="p-12" data-page="39204">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     This rule modifies the requirements on UCAs related to the calculation of risk-based profit objectives. The language at DFARS 215.404-71-3(d)(2)(i) regarding profit allowed on the contract when a contracting officer definitizes the contract after the end of the 180-day period is consistent with section 811 of the NDAA for FY 2017. However, when definitizing within the 180-day period, the requirement for the contracting officer to assess the extent to which costs have been incurred prior to definitization when determining contract type risk remains unchanged in this rule. When costs have been incurred prior to definitization, DFARS 215.404-71-3(d)(2)(i) states the contracting officer generally regards the contract type risk to be in the low end of the designated range. As such, this rule encourages submission of timely qualifying proposals by contractors and timely definitization by contracting officers.
                </p>
                <h4 id="h-13">3. Unilateral Definitization</h4>
                <p id="p-13" data-page="39204">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     One respondent indicated that restricting the authority of a contracting officer to unilaterally definitize a UCA with a value greater than $50 million without the service acquisition executive for the military department approval ensures the UCA will not be definitized within the 180

                    day window. The respondent also stated that requiring the contracting officer to provide the written approval to the contractor implies that leadership does not trust the contracting officer to be truthful.

                <p id="p-14" data-page="39205">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The language at DFARS 217.7404(b)(2) and (3) regarding the limitations on unilateral definitization of UCAs over $50 million is a statutory requirement under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2326" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2326(c)</a> and is consistent with section 815 of the NDAA for FY 2018. The rule provides greater oversight on UCAs over $50 million in accordance with Congressional intent as set forth in statute.

                <p id="p-15" data-page="39205">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     One respondent indicated that their central contention with the proposed rule is the incomplete revision of the definition of &ldquo;qualifying proposal&rdquo; at DFARS 217.7401(c) to match the statutory revisions of the definition at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2326" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2326(g)(2)</a>. The respondent also recommended that DoD establish that a proposal submitted in compliance with the Proposal Adequacy Checklist shall be deemed a &ldquo;qualifying proposal.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p id="p-16" data-page="39205">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     DoD has revised the definition to conform to the statutory definition as follows: &ldquo;Qualifying proposal&rdquo; means a proposal that contains sufficient information to enable DoD to conduct meaningful analyses and audits of information contained in the proposal. Although compliance with the proposal adequacy checklist forms a good basis for an adequate proposal, it does not necessarily ensure that the proposal contains sufficient information to enable DoD to conduct meaningful analyses and audits of information contained in the proposal.

                <p id="p-25" data-page="39205">
                    A final regulatory flexibility analysis (FRFA) has been prepared consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>, 
                    <em>et seq.</em>
                     The FRFA is summarized as follows:
                </p>
                <p id="p-26" data-page="39205">DoD is amending the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) to modify requirements on undefinitized contract actions (UCAs) regarding calculations of risk-based profit objectives, timing for definitizations, Foreign Military Sales, and limitations on unilateral definitizations of UCAs over $50 million, in accordance with recently enacted statutory requirements. The objective is to implement section 811 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2017, and section 815 of the NDAA for FY 2018.</p>
                <p id="p-27" data-page="39205">There were no issues raised by the public in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis.</p>
                <p id="p-28" data-page="39205">
                    The rule applies to all entities who do business with the Federal Government, including over 327,458 small business registrants in the System for Award Management database. However, DoD does not expect this rule to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>, 
                    <em>et seq.,</em>
                     because the rule is primarily implementing internal DoD administrative requirements. With regard to potential profit impacts, DoD estimates that this rule will impact approximately 470 contracts per year, primarily awarded to other than small entities, where definitization is extended beyond 180 days after receipt of a qualifying proposal. This would equate to less than 1/10th of one percent of contracts awarded to small entities.
                </p>
                <p id="p-29" data-page="39205">The rule does not include additional reporting or record keeping requirements.</p>
                <p id="p-30" data-page="39205">The rule does not duplicate, overlap, or conflict with any other Federal rules.</p>
                <p id="p-31" data-page="39205">There are no available alternatives to the rule to accomplish the desired objective of the statute. We do not expect this rule to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because the rule is not implementing any requirements with which small entities must comply.</p>

                <p id="p-32" data-page="39205">The rule does not contain any information collection requirements that require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/44/3501" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44 U.S.C. chapter 35</a>).</p>

When costs have been incurred prior to definitization, generally regard the contract type risk to be in the low end of the designated range. If a substantial portion of the costs have been incurred prior to definitization, the contracting officer may assign a value as low as zero percent, regardless of contract type. However, if a contractor submits a qualifying proposal to definitize an undefinitized contract action and the contracting officer for such action definitizes the contract after the end of the 180-day period beginning on the date on which the contractor submitted the qualifying proposal (as defined in 217.7401), the profit allowed on the contract shall accurately reflect the cost risk of the contractor as such risk existed on the date the contractor submitted the qualifying proposal.</p>
