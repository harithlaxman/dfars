Section 806 authorizes an agency that is an element of the intelligence community to award a contract for supplies or services in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold for the performance of a joint program conducted to meet the needs of DoD and the non-DoD agency.</p>

                <h2 id="h-7">I. Background</h2>
                <p id="p-7" data-page="9680">DoD published an interim rule at <a href="/citation/75-FR-32639" class="fr-reference" data-reference="75 FR 32639">75 FR 32639</a> on June 8, 2010, to implement section 806 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/111/public/84" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 111-84</a>), providing limitations on procurements with non-Defense agencies. The public comment period closed August 9, 2010. No comments were received in response to the interim rule.</p>
                <h2 id="h-8">II. <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">Executive Order 12866</a>
</h2>
                <p id="p-8" data-page="9680">This rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">Executive Order 12866</a>, dated September 30, 1993. This rule is not a major rule under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/804" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 804</a>.</p>
                <h2 id="h-9">III. Regulatory Flexibility Act</h2>
                <p id="p-9" data-page="9680">
                    DoD certifies that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>, 
                    <em>et seq.,</em>
                     because the rule addresses internal DoD procedural matters only. Specifically, this implementation of section 806 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, Treatment of Non-Defense Agency Procurements Under Joint Programs with Intelligence Community, amends the limitations placed on procurements by non-DoD agencies by exempting such procurements that are: (a) Entered into by a non-DoD agency that is an element of the intelligence community and (b) when the procurement is for the performance of a joint program conducted to meet the needs of DoD and the non-DoD agency. The statute resulted in changes to internal operating procedures with no impact on contractors or offerors.
