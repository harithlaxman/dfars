                    <p id="p-7" data-page="11367">This rule implements section 867 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/112/public/81" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 112-81</a>). Section 867 amends the DoD Mentor-Prot&eacute;g&eacute; Pilot Program, section 831 of Public Law 101-510 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2302" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2302</a>, note), by changing the&mdash;</p>
                    
            <ul class="bullets" >
          <li id="p-8" data-page="11367">Acceptance date for new program agreements from September 30, 2011, to September 30, 2015; and</li>
                    <li id="p-9" data-page="11367">Eligibility date DoD mentors may incur costs for the purposes of receiving cost reimbursement or credit toward attainment of subcontracting goal, from September 30, 2014, to September 30, 2018.</li>

                    <p id="p-10" data-page="11367">This final rule implements these changes in the corresponding Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) sections: 219.704(b) and (d); and Appendix I-103 (a) and (b).</p>
                    <p id="p-11" data-page="11367">DoD has issued a final rule because this rule does not have a significant effect beyond the internal operating procedures of DoD and does not have a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors. This final rule merely extends the effective dates for an existing DoD program. These dates have already been extended by law.</p>
                    <h2 id="h-8">II. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563</h2>
                    <p id="p-12" data-page="11367">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993. This rule is not a major rule under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/804" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 804</a>.</p>
                    <h2 id="h-9">III. Regulatory Flexibility Act</h2>
                    <p id="p-13" data-page="11367">The Regulatory Flexibility Act does not apply to this rule because this final rule does not constitute a significant DFARS revision as defined within the meaning at FAR 1.501-1, and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1707" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1707</a> does not require publication for public comment.</p>
