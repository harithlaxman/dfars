                    <p id="p-8" data-page="35865">The comment period for the FAR interim rule closed on August 20, 2013. No public comments were received; therefore DoD, GSA, and NASA are finalizing the interim rule without change.</p>

                    <p id="p-9" data-page="35865">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993. This rule is not a major rule under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/804" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 804</a>.</p>

                        DoD, GSA, and NASA have prepared a Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (FRFA) consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>, 
                        <em>et seq.</em>
                         The FRFA is summarized as follows:
                    </p>
                    
                        <p id="p-11" data-page="35865">
                            The objective of this final rule is to finalize the changes set forth in section 1697 of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2013. Section 1697 eliminated the statutory limitations (thresholds) at section 8(m) of the Small Business Act, (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/15/637" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15 U.S.C. 637(m)</a>), for set-asides to economically disadvantaged women-owned small business (EDWOSB) concerns and to women-owned small business (WOSB) concerns eligible under the WOSB Program in industries that are underrepresented or substantially underrepresented by WOSB concerns. This final rule follows an interim rule that was published in the 
                            <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                             at <a href="/citation/78-FR-37692" class="fr-reference" data-reference="78 FR 37692">78 FR 37692</a> on June 21, 2013, which removed the set-aside limitations set forth at FAR 19.1505(b)(2) and (c)(2), in keeping with the statutory change and SBA's revised regulations.
                        </p>
                        <p id="p-12" data-page="35865">There were no comments received in response to the interim rule by its closing date of August 20, 2013. Therefore, the changes made in the interim rule will be adopted as final, without change, allowing contracting officers to set aside acquisitions for competition restricted to EDWOSB concerns or WOSB concerns eligible under the WOSB Program at any dollar level above the micro-purchase threshold, provided the other requirements for a set-aside under the WOSB Program are met.</p>
                        <p id="p-13" data-page="35865">Analysis of the Federal Procurement Data System from April 1, 2011 (the implementation date of the WOSB Program) through January 1, 2013, revealed that there were approximately 26,712 WOSB concerns, including 131 EDWOSB concerns and 388 WOSB concerns eligible under the WOSB Program, that received obligated funds from Federal contract awards, task or delivery orders, and modifications to existing contracts. This final rule may have a significant positive economic impact on EDWOSB concerns competing for contracting opportunities in industries determined by SBA to be underrepresented by WOSB concerns and may positively affect WOSB concerns eligible under the WOSB Program competing in industries determined by SBA to be substantially underrepresented by WOSB concerns, since removing the dollar threshold for set-asides under the WOSB Program will provide greater access to Federal contracting opportunities. However, this rule may have a negative effect on firms that are women-owned but are not WOSB Program participants and small businesses that are not owned by women because those firms may now be excluded from competition on some acquisitions that previously could not be set aside for EDWOSB concerns or WOSB concerns eligible under the WOSB Program due to the dollar thresholds and now will be set aside.</p>
                        <p id="p-14" data-page="35865">This final rule does not impose new recordkeeping or reporting requirements. The rule does not duplicate, overlap, or conflict with any other Federal rules. There are no alternatives to the rule that would accomplish the stated objectives of the statute.</p>
