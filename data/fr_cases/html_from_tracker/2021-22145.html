L. 114-92</a>, codified at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/15/644" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15 U.S.C. 644(e)(3)</a> and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/15/657q" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15 U.S.C. 657q(c)(2)</a>) and the Small Business Administration (SBA) implementing regulations. SBA published a final rule to implement section 863 on November 29, 2019, at <a href="/citation/84-FR-65647" class="fr-reference" data-reference="84 FR 65647">84 FR 65647</a>.</p>
                    <p id="p-7" data-page="61038">Section 863 requires public notification of an agency's determination to substantially bundle or consolidate contract requirements. Specifically, publication of a notice is required when the head of a contracting agency determines that an acquisition plan for a procurement involves substantial bundling of contract requirements. The head of the contracting agency must publish a notice on a public website that such determination has been made not later than 7 days after making the determination. Any solicitation for a procurement related to the acquisition plan may not be published earlier than 7 days after such notice is published. A justification for the determination must be published with the solicitation. The justification must address the specific benefits anticipated, any alternative approaches, impediments to participation by small business concerns as prime contractors, and actions designed to maximize participation of small business concerns as subcontractors (see <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/15/644" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15 U.S.C. 644(e)(3)(A)</a> through <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/15/644" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(C)</a>).</p>
                    <p id="p-8" data-page="61038">Section 863 also requires publication of a notice when the senior procurement executive (SPE) or chief acquisition officer (CAO) makes a determination that an acquisition strategy involving consolidation of contract requirements is necessary and justified under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/15/657q" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15 U.S.C. 657q(c)(2)(A)</a>. The SPE or CAO must publish a notice on a public website that such determination has been made not later than 7 days after making the determination. Any solicitation for a procurement related to the acquisition strategy may not be published earlier than 7 days after such notice is published. A justification for the determination must be published with the solicitation. The justification must include the information in <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/15/657q" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15 U.S.C. 657q(c)(1)(A)</a> through <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/15/657q" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(E)</a>.</p>
                    <p id="p-9" data-page="61038">As a result, this final rule amends FAR 7.107-5, Notifications, to require the publication on the Governmentwide Point of Entry of a notice of substantial bundling or of a notice of consolidation, as required in the SBA final rule. This section also contains references to the required content of the consolidation determination (at FAR 7.107-2) and the substantial bundling determination (at FAR 7.107-4).</p>

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         Two respondents expressed concern about the 7-day notification period, stating that it is not enough time for small businesses to plan and strategize. The respondents requested the notification posting period be extended for a longer time, at least 2 weeks.

                         One respondent suggested that the existing requirement to publish the notification on a &ldquo;public site&rdquo; is too vague and that compliance could be satisfied by posting on an agency's social media platform. The respondent recommends that all notifications should be posted on 
                        <em>beta.sam</em>
                         via the Governmentwide point of entry (GPE).

                        and consolidation of contract requirements. FAR 7.107-5(b)(1) currently requires annual publication on the agency website of a list of bundled contracts and rationale, because section 1312 of <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/111/public/240" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Public Law 111-240</a> requires it. Thus, this rule could not mandate that all notifications be published on SAM via the GPE.

                    <p id="p-19" data-page="61039">Additionally, the FAR text is amended at 7.107-5(c) and 7.107-5(d) to require the Senior Procurement Executive or Chief Acquisition Officer to publish notifications of consolidation and substantial bundling of contract requirements in the GPE not later than 7 days after making such a determination and prior to issuance of the solicitation. The FAR does not use social media as a publication platform. No changes were made to the FAR text as a result of this comment.</p>

                         One respondent questioned why the required notification did not apply to all bundled procurements. The respondent further stated that the definition for substantial bundling should be referenced to provide guidance to the procurement office.

                         This rule implements section 863 of the NDAA for FY 2016 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/114/public/92" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 114-92</a>) and the SBA implementing regulations, which require publication of notices when a procurement involves consolidation or substantial bundling of contract requirements. The definition for substantial bundling can be found at 7.107-4(a)(1). Neither section 863 nor the SBA regulations altered notification requirements for bundled procurements below the substantial bundling threshold; therefore, this final rule does not apply these requirements below the substantial bundling threshold.

                         One respondent questioned whether information is being withheld from the proposed rule. Another respondent stated that SBA procurement center representatives often disagree with the bundling justification but sign form 2579 despite their opposition. The respondent further stated that small business subcontractors are not being utilized by large businesses given that there is &ldquo;no punishment for a large not subcontracting&rdquo; and no incentive for large businesses to comply with subcontracting goals beyond their initial proposal submission. Additionally, the respondent stated that bundling has been prohibited in Federal acquisition and recommends the following actions:

                         The respondents' comments are outside the scope of this FAR rule. The Councils note that FAR 19.502-8 addresses the process for SBA PCRs to appeal the contracting officer's rejection of SBA's recommendation.

The FRFA is summarized as follows:</p>
                    
                        <p id="p-30" data-page="61039">This rule is necessary to implement section 863 of the National Defense Authorization Act for 2016 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/114/public/92" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 114-92</a>, codified at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/15/644" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15 U.S.C. 644(e)(3)</a> and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/15/657q" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15 U.S.C. 657q(c)(2)</a>), and the Small Business Administration (SBA) implementing regulations. Section 863 requires the head of a contracting agency to publish a notice on a public website within 7 days of making the determination that an acquisition plan involves a substantial bundling of contract requirements. Additionally, section 863 requires the senior procurement executive or chief acquisition officer to publish a notice on a public website that consolidation of contract requirements is necessary and justified. For substantial bundling and for consolidation, the agency may not issue the solicitation any earlier than 7 days after publication of the notices described above. The agency must also publish the justification along with the solicitation. The objective of this rule is to amend the FAR to require that a notice of substantial bundling or of a notice of consolidation be published on the Governmentwide Point of Entry, as required in the SBA final rule. This section also contains references to the required content of the consolidation determination (at FAR 7.107-2) and the substantial bundling determination (at FAR 7.107-4).</p>

By posting justifications and notices of upcoming procurements that are planned to be substantially bundled or consolidated, small business concerns are made aware of potential subcontracting opportunities and possibilities for participating in joint ventures or small business teaming arrangements, which will help small businesses increase their competitiveness. The System for Award Management shows 315,655 entities that are small business concerns under at least one North American Industry Classification System code.</p>
