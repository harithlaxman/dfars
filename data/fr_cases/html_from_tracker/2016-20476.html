                <h2 id="h-7">I. Background</h2>
                <p id="p-6" data-page="59510">
                    DoD is amending DFARS 225.872-6 to specify the qualifying countries that have audit agreements with the United States (
                    <em>i.e.,</em>
                     France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom).
                </p>
                <h2 id="h-8">II. Publication of This Final Rule for Public Comment Is Not Required by Statute</h2>
                <p id="p-7" data-page="59510">The statute that applies to the publication of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) is <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1707" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1707</a> entitled &ldquo;Publication of Proposed Regulations.&rdquo; Paragraph (a)(1) of the statute requires that a procurement policy, regulation, procedure, or form (including an amendment or modification thereof) must be published for public comment if it relates to the expenditure of appropriated funds, and has either a significant effect beyond the internal operating procedures of the agency issuing the policy, regulation, procedure, or form, or a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors. This final rule is not required to be published for public comment, because it only specifies the qualifying countries that have audit agreements with the United States, rather than requiring each contracting officer to contact the Deputy Director of Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy (Contract Policy and International Contracting), to determine whether a qualifying country has such an audit agreement. These regulations affect only the internal operating procedures of the Government.</p>
                <h2 id="h-9">III. Applicability to Contracts at or Below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT) and for Commercial Items, Including Commercially Available Off-the-Shelf (COTS) Items</h2>
                <p id="p-8" data-page="59510">This case does not add any new provisions or clauses or impact any existing provisions or clauses.</p>
                <h2 id="h-10">IV. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563</h2>
                <p id="p-9" data-page="59510">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993. This rule is not a major rule under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/804" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 804</a>.</p>
                <h2 id="h-11">V. Regulatory Flexibility Act</h2>
                <p id="p-10" data-page="59510">The Regulatory Flexibility Act does not apply to this rule because this final rule does not constitute a significant DFARS revision within the meaning of FAR 1.501-1, and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1707" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1707</a> does not require publication for public comment.</p>
                <h2 id="h-12">VI. Paperwork Reduction Act</h2>
                <p id="p-11" data-page="59510">The rule does not contain any information collection requirements that require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/44/3501" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44 U.S.C. chapter 35</a>).</p>
