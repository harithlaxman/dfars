                <p id="p-6" data-page="12682">
                    DoD published a proposed rule in the 
                    <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                     at <a href="/citation/81-FR-65610" class="fr-reference" data-reference="81 FR 65610">81 FR 65610</a> on September 23, 2016, to propose revisions to the DFARS to implement section 861 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/114/public/92" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 114-92</a>). Section 861 provides several amendments to the DoD Pilot Mentor-Prot&eacute;g&eacute; Program (&ldquo;the Program&rdquo;), including new reporting requirements for mentor firms to provide information to DoD's Office of Small Business Programs to support decisions regarding continuation of particular mentor-prot&eacute;g&eacute; agreements. In addition, section 861 adds new eligibility criteria; adds limitations on a prot&eacute;g&eacute; firm's participation in the Program; adds new elements to mentor-prot&eacute;g&eacute; agreements; extends the Program for three years to September 30, 2021; and amends requirements for business development assistance provided by a mentor firm and for reimbursement of fees assessed by the mentor firm.

                <h2 id="h-8">II. Discussion and Analysis</h2>
                <p id="p-7" data-page="12682">One respondent submitted a public comment in response to the proposed rule. DoD reviewed the public comment in the development of the final rule.</p>

                <p id="p-8" data-page="12682">There are no changes made to the final rule as a result of the public comment; however, one conforming change is made.</p>
                <h3 id="h-10">B. Analysis of Public Comments</h3>
                <p id="p-9" data-page="12682">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     The respondent requested that DoD revise the Program's eligibility criteria for prot&eacute;g&eacute; firms to include Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs). Allowing HBCUs and MIs to participate in the Program as prot&eacute;g&eacute;s would provide the opportunity for teaming arrangements with DoD prime contractors, as well as good research opportunities.
                </p>
                <p id="p-10" data-page="12682">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The eligibility criteria are based on the statutory authority for the Program (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2302" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2302 note</a>), which provides that a &ldquo;disadvantaged small business concern&rdquo; meeting certain criteria may participate as a prot&eacute;g&eacute; in the Program. The statutory definition of &ldquo;disadvantaged small business concern&rdquo; does not include HBCUs or MIs. Therefore, the statute does not support the inclusion of HBCUs and MIs as prot&eacute;g&eacute;s. However, HBCUs and MIs have a role in the Program as providers of assistance to prot&eacute;g&eacute; firms.
                </p>
                <h3 id="h-11">C. Other Changes From the Proposed Rule</h3>
                <p id="p-11" data-page="12682">A conforming change is made to the definition of &ldquo;nontraditional defense contractor&rdquo; in Appendix I, Paragraph I-101.2, to reflect the definition for this term that was established in the final rule &ldquo;Procurement of Commercial Items (DFARS Case 2016-D006)&rdquo; (see <a href="/citation/83-FR-4431" class="fr-reference" data-reference="83 FR 4431">83 FR 4431</a>, dated January 31, 2018). Several Appendix I references are revised to reflect that, as of February 1, 2018, the Office of Small Business Programs is now organizationally located within DoD under Acquisition and Sustainment (A&amp;S) in lieu of Acquisition Technology and Logistics (AT&amp;L).</p>

                    This final rule amends the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) to implement section 861 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2016, which provides amendments to the DoD Pilot Mentor-Prot&eacute;g&eacute; Program (&ldquo;the Program&rdquo;). Specifically, section 861 provides new reporting requirements for mentor firms that will provide information to DoD's Office of Small Business Programs to support decisions regarding continuation of particular mentor-prot&eacute;g&eacute; agreements. In addition, section 861 adds new eligibility criteria; adds limitations on a prot&eacute;g&eacute; firm's participation in the Program; adds new elements to mentor-prot&eacute;g&eacute; agreements; extends the Program for three additional years; and amends requirements for business development assistance provided by a mentor firm and for reimbursement of fees assessed by the mentor firm.
