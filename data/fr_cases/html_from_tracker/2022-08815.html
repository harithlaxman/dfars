                    DoD published a proposed rule in the 
                    <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                     at <a href="/citation/86-FR-59951" class="fr-reference" data-reference="86 FR 59951">86 FR 59951</a> on October 29, 2021, to revise the DFARS to implement paragraph (a)(2) of section 831 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/116/public/283" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 116-283</a>). Section 831(a)(2) amends <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2302e" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2302e(a)</a> to revise the type of contract line items or options that may be included, without additional competition, in contracts initially awarded from the competitive selection of a proposal resulting from a broad agency announcement.
                </p>
                <p id="p-8" data-page="25144">One respondent submitted a public comment in response to the proposed rule.</p>
                <h2 id="h-8">II. Discussion and Analysis</h2>
                <p id="p-9" data-page="25144">DoD reviewed the public comment in the development of the final rule. The public comment is outside the scope of this rule; therefore, there are no changes made to the final rule.</p>
                <h2 id="h-9">III. Applicability to Contracts at or Below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT), for Commercial Products Including Commercially Available Off-the-Shelf (COTS) Items, and for Commercial Services</h2>
                <p id="p-10" data-page="25144">This rule does not create any new solicitation provisions or contract clauses. It does not impact any existing solicitation provisions or contract clauses or their applicability to contracts at or below the simplified acquisition threshold, for commercial products including COTS items, or for commercial services.</p>
                <h2 id="h-10">IV. Expected Impact of the Rule</h2>
                <p id="p-11" data-page="25144">
                    The final rule impacts DoD acquisition planning decisions for contract awards that will result from the competitive selection of a proposal in response to a broad agency announcement for which DoD intends to include a contract line item or option

                    for the development and demonstration of technology developed under the contract. The final rule broadens the scope of effort for which these contract line items and contract options can be awarded and the type of funding that may be used to fund these line items or options. This final rule also helps streamline the process for moving technologies developed under such contracts from science and technology into production.

                <p id="p-12" data-page="25145">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993.</p>
                <h2 id="h-12">VI. Congressional Review Act</h2>
                <p id="p-13" data-page="25145">
                    As required by the Congressional Review Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/801" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 801-808</a>) before an interim or final rule takes effect, DoD will submit a copy of the interim or final rule with the form, Submission of Federal Rules under the Congressional Review Act, to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Comptroller General of the United States. A major rule under the Congressional Review Act cannot take effect until 60 days after it is published in the 
                    <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                    . The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has determined that this rule is not a major rule under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/804" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 804</a>.

                <p id="p-14" data-page="25145">
                    A final regulatory flexibility analysis (FRFA) has been prepared consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>, 
                    <em>et seq.</em>
                     The FRFA is summarized as follows:
                </p>
                <p id="p-15" data-page="25145">This final rule implements paragraph (a)(2) of section 831 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/116/public/283" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 116-283</a>). The objective of this rule is to revise the type of contract line items or options that may be included, without additional competition, in contracts initially awarded from the competitive selection of a proposal resulting from a broad agency announcement.</p>
                <p id="p-16" data-page="25145">When awarding such a contract, contracting officers may now include a contract line item or contract option for the &ldquo;development and demonstration&rdquo; of technology developed under the contract. This revision provides a broader scope of effort and funding for which these contract line items and contract options can be awarded, which in turn helps streamline the process for moving technologies developed under such contracts from science and technology into production.</p>
                <p id="p-17" data-page="25145">There were no significant issues raised by public comments in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis.</p>
                <p id="p-18" data-page="25145">Based on data from the Federal Procurement Data System for FY 2018 through FY 2020, on average, DoD annually awards 300 contracts to 200 unique small entities using the competitive selection of proposals resulting from a broad agency announcement.</p>
                <p id="p-19" data-page="25145">This rule does not impose any new reporting, recordkeeping, or other compliance requirements.</p>
                <p id="p-20" data-page="25145">There are no significant alternatives to this rule that would accomplish the objective of the statute.</p>

                <p id="p-21" data-page="25145">The rule does not contain any information collection requirements that require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/44/3501" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44 U.S.C. chapter 35</a>).</p>
