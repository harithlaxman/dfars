                        DoD, GSA, and NASA published an interim rule in the 
                        <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                         at <a href="/citation/80-FR-81888" class="fr-reference" data-reference="80 FR 81888">80 FR 81888</a> on December 31, 2015, to implement regulatory changes that the SBA has made in its final rule published in the 
                        <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                         at <a href="/citation/80-FR-55019" class="fr-reference" data-reference="80 FR 55019">80 FR 55019</a>, on September 14, 2015, concerning sole source award authority under the WOSB Program. SBA's final rule implements the statutory requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of section 825 of the Carl Levin and Howard P. &ldquo;Buck&rdquo; McKeon National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2015, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/113/public/291" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Public Law 113-291</a>, granting contracting officers the authority to award sole source contracts to economically disadvantaged women-owned small business (EDWOSB) concerns and to WOSB concerns eligible under the WOSB Program. Four respondents submitted comments on the interim rule.
                    </p>
                    <h2 id="h-8">II. Discussion and Analysis</h2>
                    <p id="p-8" data-page="67735">The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council (the Councils) reviewed the public comments in the development of the final rule. All four respondents expressed support of the interim rule. Therefore, no further change to the interim rule is required as a result of the public comments, but there is a minor edit to 19.1505(a)(1).</p>
                    <h2 id="h-9">III. Applicability to Contracts at or Below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold and for Commercial Items, Including Commercially Available Off-the-Shelf Items</h2>
                    <p id="p-9" data-page="67735">This rule adopts as final the amendments to the FAR clauses at 52.219-29, Notice of Set-Aside for, or Sole Source Award to, Economically Disadvantaged Women-owned Small Business Concerns, and 52.219-30, Notice of Set-Aside for, or Sole Source Award to, Women-Owned Small Business Concerns Eligible Under the Women-Owned Small Business Program, in order to implement paragraph (a)(3) of section 825 of the NDAA for FY 2015. The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council, pursuant to the authority granted in <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1905" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1905</a> and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1906" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1906</a>, and the Administrator, Office of Federal Procurement Policy, pursuant to the authority granted in <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1907" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C 1907</a>, have determined that the application of this statutory authority to contracts at or below the simplified acquisition threshold and to contracts for commercial items and commercially available off-the-shelf items, is in the best interests of the Federal Government.</p>
                    <h2 id="h-10">IV. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563</h2>
                    <p id="p-10" data-page="67735">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993. This rule is not a major rule under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/804" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 804</a>.</p>

                    <p id="p-11" data-page="67735">
                        DoD, GSA, and NASA have prepared a Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (FRFA) consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>, 
                        <em>et seq.</em>
                         The FRFA is summarized as follows:

                        <p id="p-12" data-page="67735">
                            This rule implements paragraph (a)(3) of section 825 of the Carl Levin and Howard P. `Buck' McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/113/public/291" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Public Law 113-291</a>, (Fiscal Year 2015 NDAA). Section 825 of the Fiscal Year 2015 NDAA included language granting contracting officers the authority to award sole source contracts to Women-Owned Small Businesses (WOSBs) and Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Businesses (EDWOSBs) under the WOSB Program. The purpose of this rule is to finalize the procedures whereby Federal agencies may award sole source contracts to WOSBs and EDWOSBs eligible under the WOSB Program. The rule provides an additional tool for Federal agencies to ensure that WOSBs have an equal opportunity to participate in Federal contracting and ensures consistency among SBA's socioeconomic small business contracting programs.

                        <p id="p-14" data-page="67736">There were no significant issues raised by the public in response to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis provided in the interim rule.</p>

                            This rule may have a positive economic impact on WOSB concerns. The Dynamic Small Business Supplemental Search (DSBS) lists approximately 41,500 firms as either WOSBs or EDWOSBs under the WOSB Program. An analysis of the Federal Procurement Data System from April 1, 2011 (the implementation date of the WOSB Program), through September 1, 2015, revealed that there were approximately 17,353 women-owned small business concerns that received obligated funds from Federal contract awards, task or delivery orders, and modifications to existing contracts, in an industry where a WOSB or EDWOSB sole source is authorized, and where the contract is valued at or below the thresholds for sole source contracts to WOSBs or EDWOSBs. Of those 17,353 women-owned small business concerns, 328 EDWOSBs and 974 WOSBs were eligible to participate in the WOSB Program (

                             received set-asides under the WOSB Program), and could have received sole source awards. This rule could affect a smaller number of EDWOSBs and WOSBs than those eligible under the WOSB Program since the sole source authority can only be used where a contracting officer conducts market research in an industry where a WOSB or EDWOSB set-aside is authorized, and cannot identify two or more eligible EDWOSB or WOSB concerns that can perform at a fair and reasonable price, but identifies one WOSB or EDWOSB that can perform. In addition, the sole source authority for WOSBs and EDWOSBs is limited to contracts valued at $6.5 million or less for manufacturing contracts and $4 million or less for all other contracts.
