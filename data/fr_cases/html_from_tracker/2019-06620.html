                    <p id="p-8" data-page="19835">No public comments were submitted in response to the proposed rule. Therefore, there are no changes made to the final rule.</p>

                    <p id="p-9" data-page="19835">Prior to enactment of the NDAA for FY 2017, for acquisitions of supplies or services that are to be used to support a contingency operation, or to facilitate defense against or recovery from nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological attack, agencies had the authority, as provided in FAR part 13, to utilize the higher MPT of $20,000 in lieu of $3,500 in the case of any contract to be awarded and performed, or purchase to be made, inside the United States; and $30,000 in the case of any contract to be awarded and performed, or purchase to be made, outside the United States (except for acquisitions of construction subject to <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/40/3101" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">40 U.S.C. chapter 31</a>, subchapter IV, Wage Rate requirements (Construction)). Additionally, prior to the enactment of the NDAA for FY 2017, agencies had the authority, as provided in FAR part 13, to utilize the higher SAT of $750,000 in lieu of $150,000 for any contract to be awarded and performed, or purchase to be made, inside the United States; and $1.5 million for any contract to be awarded and performed, or purchase to be made, outside the United States; and utilize the higher threshold of $13 million in lieu of $7 million for use of simplified acquisition procedures (SAP) for the acquisition of commercial items (including acquisitions treated as acquisitions of commercial items to facilitate defense against or recovery from nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological attack).</p>
                    <p id="p-10" data-page="19835">
                        This final rule expands the use of the special emergency procurement authorities to apply to acquisitions of supplies or services that facilitate defense against or recovery from a cyber attack; support a request from the Secretary of State or the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development to facilitate provision of international disaster assistance pursuant to <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/22/2292" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">22 U.S.C. 2292</a> 
                        <em>et seq.</em>; or support a response to an emergency or major disaster (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/42/5122" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">42 U.S.C. 5122</a>).
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-11" data-page="19835">This rule will impact all businesses that submit offers in response to Federal solicitations for supplies or services covered by the expanded special emergency procurement authorities. Acquisitions with an estimated value between the MPT or SAT and the higher thresholds for the expanded special emergency procurement authorities will use simplified procedures, thereby reducing the requirements imposed on the offerors when responding to the solicitation.</p>
                    <p id="p-12" data-page="19835">DoD, GSA, and NASA have performed a regulatory cost analysis on this final rule. The following is a summary of the estimated public cost savings calculated in 2016 dollars at a 7-percent discount rate and in perpetuity:</p>

Based on an average of contract actions reported in the Federal Procurement Data System data for fiscal years 2014&mdash;2016, this rule applies to less than 100 small entities that submit offers in response to solicitations for the acquisition of supplies or services&mdash;</p>
