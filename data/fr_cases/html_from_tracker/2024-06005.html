                <p id="p-9" data-page="20875">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     One respondent recommended the rule be amended to allow a prot&eacute;g&eacute; to have more than one mentor at a time, as long as the mentors are not competitors and do not have any conflicts of interest. The respondent indicated that this would align with the Small Business Administration (SBA) Mentor-Prot&eacute;g&eacute; Program (MPP), which allows a prot&eacute;g&eacute; to have two mentors at the same time.
                </p>
                <p id="p-10" data-page="20875">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     This rule implements section 856 of the NDAA for FY 2023, which is codified at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/4902" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 4902</a>. <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/4902" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paragraph (c)(2) of 10 U.S.C. 4902</a> indicates that a prot&eacute;g&eacute; firm may not be party to more than one mentor-prot&eacute;g&eacute; agreement concurrently. This means that a prot&eacute;g&eacute; may have only one mentor during the term of an agreement. Therefore, the proposed change is inconsistent with the statute. However, because the statute allows a prot&eacute;g&eacute; firm to participate in the DoD MPP for a 5-year period beginning on the date the prot&eacute;g&eacute; firm enters into its first mentor-prot&eacute;g&eacute; agreement, a prot&eacute;g&eacute; may have more than one mentor during the 5-year period as long as the prot&eacute;g&eacute; is not a party to more than one mentor-prot&eacute;g&eacute; agreement at a time. For example, if a prot&eacute;g&eacute; firm enters into a 2-year mentor-prot&eacute;g&eacute; agreement with a mentor, then the prot&eacute;g&eacute; firm could enter into another mentor-prot&eacute;g&eacute; agreement with a different mentor after the conclusion of the first agreement, as long as it did so within the 5-year period and the second agreement does not extend beyond the 5-year period from date the prot&eacute;g&eacute; firm entered into its first mentor-prot&eacute;g&eacute; agreement. As such, a prot&eacute;g&eacute; firm under the DoD MPP may still benefit from having more than one mentor during its participation in the program.
                </p>
                <h3 id="h-11">C. Other Changes</h3>
                <p id="p-11" data-page="20875">Minor editorial changes are made in appendix I, section I-106.</p>
                <h2 id="h-12">III. Applicability to Contracts at or Below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT), for Commercial Products (Including Commercially Available Off-the-Shelf (COTS) Items), and for Commercial Services</h2>
                <p id="p-12" data-page="20875">This final rule amends the clause at DFARS 252.232-7005, Reimbursement of Subcontractor Advance Payments&mdash;DoD Pilot Mentor-Prot&eacute;g&eacute; Program, to remove the word &ldquo;Pilot&rdquo; from the clause title. However, this final rule does not impose any new requirements on contracts at or below the SAT, for commercial products including COTS items, or for commercial services. The clause will continue to not apply to acquisitions at or below the SAT, to acquisitions of commercial products including COTS items, and to acquisitions of commercial services.</p>
                <h2 id="h-13">IV. Expected Impact of the Rule</h2>
                <p id="p-13" data-page="20875">This final rule implements the permanent authorization of and statutory amendments to the DoD Mentor-Prot&eacute;g&eacute; Program. The purpose of the program is to provide incentives to DoD contractors to furnish eligible small business concerns with assistance designed to&mdash;</p>
                <p id="p-14" data-page="20875">(1) Enhance the capabilities of small business concerns to perform as subcontractors and suppliers under DoD contracts and other Federal Government contracts and subcontracts; and</p>
                <p id="p-15" data-page="20875">(2) Increase the participation of small business concerns as subcontractors and suppliers under DoD contracts, other Federal Government contracts, and contracts with commercial entities.</p>
                <p id="p-16" data-page="20875">Therefore, this final rule will benefit small business concerns that participate in the program by extending the opportunity to enter into DoD Mentor-Prot&eacute;g&eacute; agreements and extending the term of the agreements. This final rule is also expected to benefit large entities and DoD by expanding the defense industrial base.</p>
                <h2 id="h-14">V. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563</h2>
                <p id="p-17" data-page="20875">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, as amended.</p>
                <h2 id="h-15">VI. Congressional Review Act</h2>

A major rule under the Congressional Review Act cannot take effect until 60 days after it is published in the 
                    <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                    . The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has determined that this rule is not a major rule as defined by <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/804" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 804</a>.

Section 856 also extends the term for program participation and removes the term limitation for mentors to incur costs under agreements entered into after December 23, 2022. The objective of this rule is to implement the permanent authorization of the DoD Mentor-Prot&eacute;g&eacute; Program and to make other Program changes.</p>

The average number of new agreements entered into during the last three fiscal years was approximately 33, with an average of 78 total active agreements per fiscal year. DoD estimates 44 new agreements will be entered into in FY 2024, with a total of 76 active agreements in place. As of January 5, 2024, there are 62 unique small entities with active agreements.

                <p id="p-23" data-page="20876">This final rule does not impose any new reporting, recordkeeping, or other compliance requirements for small entities.</p>
                <p id="p-24" data-page="20876">DoD did not identify any significant alternatives to the rule that would accomplish the stated objectives of the statute and that would minimize the significant economic impact of the rule on small entities.
