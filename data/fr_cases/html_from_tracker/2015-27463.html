                    <p id="p-9" data-page="67244">1. Language is added to the rule to clarify that section 806 authority is only applicable when acquiring information technology, whether as a service or as a supply, that is a covered system, is a part of a covered system, or is in support of a covered system, including clarification of the prescriptions for DFARS provision 252.239-7017, Notice of Supply Chain Risk, and DFARS clause 252.239-7018, Supply Chain Risk.</p>
                    <p id="p-10" data-page="67244">2. Guidance on the use of an evaluation factor regarding supply chain risk is modified to require the inclusion of the evaluation factor when acquiring information technology, whether as a service or as a supply that is a covered system, is a part of a covered system, or is in support of a covered system. Additional text regarding an evaluation factor has been added at DFARS 212.301, 213.106-1, 214.201-5, and 214.503-1.</p>
                    <p id="p-11" data-page="67244">3. DFARS clause 252.239-7018, Supply Chain Risk, is changed as follows&mdash;</p>

                    <p id="p-14" data-page="67244">
                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         Numerous respondents urged DoD to rescind the interim rule and reissue the rule as a proposed rule. One respondent suggested that the new rule authorizes the exclusion of businesses from the defense industrial base and that such authority should not be exercised without first hearing the views of and gathering all relevant information from the parties that will be directly impacted by this rule. One respondent commented that the rule could prevent suppliers from addressing and mitigating supply chain security risks, and that a public comment period would have allowed industry to suggest alternative approaches that could allow for risk mitigation. Another respondent commented that the interim rule denies industry and other critical stakeholders ample time, opportunity to shape, and ultimately collaborate with the DoD to design a complex program that addresses multiple risks and complexities. One respondent added that without a standard notice-and-comment rulemaking process, industry has no opportunity to comment on areas of concern before the rule takes effect whereby industry must incur costs and move towards compliance without guidance through the rulemaking process.

                        <em>Response:</em>
                         DoD issued an interim rule because of the need to protect national security systems (NSS) and the integrity of its supply chains. The rule implements the specific authorities provided in the statute. The pilot authority provided for by the statute will expire September 30, 2018. It is in DoD's interest to initiate the pilot program and begin gathering feedback for its report to Congress. DoD considered all public comments received during the public comment period in the formation of this final rule.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         Several respondents objected to the broad definitions of &ldquo;covered system&rdquo; and &ldquo;covered item.&rdquo; One respondent questioned why the Council chose to use the term &ldquo;covered item&rdquo; versus &ldquo;covered item of supply,&rdquo; which is the term used in section 806.

                        <em>Response:</em>
                         The definitions in the rule are taken directly from the statute. In the final rule, the term &ldquo;covered item&rdquo; has been replaced by the term &ldquo;covered item of supply,&rdquo; thereby conforming to the statute.

                         The same respondent commented that the definition of &ldquo;information technology&rdquo; is defined even more expansively than in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 2.1, covering information systems ranging from systems used for intelligence activities to information systems used for the &ldquo;direct fulfillment of military or intelligence missions.&rdquo;

                         The definition of &ldquo;information technology&rdquo; in the rule is the same as in the statute (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/40/11101" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">40 U.S.C. 11101(6)</a>).

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent requested that DoD clarify the definition of &ldquo;supply chain risk,&rdquo; stating that DoD should clarify the phrase &ldquo;maliciously introduce unwanted function&rdquo; to clearly explain if this is a hardware or software concern or both, and recognize that threats posed maliciously are just one class of threat.

                         The definition of &ldquo;supply chain risk&rdquo; is taken directly from the statute. It addresses both hardware and software concerns and is the only class of threat to which section 806 and the rule apply.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         Three respondents commented that the scope is overly broad, recommending that DoD should include the rule's provisions and clauses in NSS solicitations and contracts only. One of these respondents commented that the rule should be narrowly scoped to reflect the intent of Congress, suggesting that DoD should include the rule's provisions and clauses in solicitations and contracts for information technology NSS rather than all information technology solicitations and contract, 
                        <em>i.e.,</em>
                         only in &ldquo;covered procurements.&rdquo; Another respondent commented that DoD should establish an independent, special review council to evaluate issues such as: (1) &ldquo;covered&rdquo; systems, technologies, items, procurements, and contracts; and (2) circumstances where the clause needs to be included and where information will be withheld under DFARS 239.7305(d), thus providing an independent check to ensure that this authority is being used in a manner consistent with section 806 of the FY 2011 NDAA and the underlying policy. This respondent also suggested that successful offerors be provided information that their contracts are covered by the clause. One respondent suggested that DoD should provide offerors sufficient notice that the goods or services they offer are to be used in a covered procurement.

                        <em>Response:</em>
                         The final rule limits use of the solicitation provision and contract clause to solicitations and contracts for information technology, whether acquired as a service or as a supply, that is a covered system, is a part of a covered system, or is in support of a covered system, as that term is defined at 239.7301.

                    <p id="p-24" data-page="67245">
                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent commented that mundane systems will be over classified by program managers as NSS and that NSS classifications should be reserved to an appropriate level above program manager. This respondent further stated that DoD should take steps to clearly designate systems as &ldquo;NSS&rdquo; and limit the NSS classification. Another respondent stated that because the interim rule incorporates the definition in <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/44/3542" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44 U.S.C. 3542(b)</a> for &ldquo;National Security System&rdquo;, the rule's approach to include the clause in all DoD contracts seems contrary to the legislative intent to limit application to &ldquo;covered procurements&rdquo; as defined in section 806(e)(3) of the FY 2011 NDAA. This respondent further suggested that DoD more narrowly define when contracting officers should include and use this clause (
                        <em>e.g.,</em>
                         what types of programs) and create some independent review of contracting activities' decisions to apply the interim rule.

                        <em>Response:</em>
                         In the final rule, the use of the provision and clause is only required when acquiring information technology, whether as a service or as a supply, that is a covered system, is a part of a covered system, or is in support of a covered system, as defined at DFARS 252.239-7302. In accordance with DoD Instruction 8510.01, Risk Management Framework (RMF) for DoD Information Technology (IT), the requiring activity/program office will designate systems as NSS when it registers them in the DoD Component registry (

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent suggested that because the clause is written to require flowdown to subcontractors regardless of tier, the Government intends to have the right to direct a supplier at any tier to be excluded for a contract. The respondent further stated that this could lead to even greater disruption of a program's supply chain since the loss of a supplier at a remote tier can have ripple effects on all higher-tier contractors and that the potential costs for the delay, disruption, and potential workarounds required to address the situation could be enormous. Failing to address the effects of exclusion of subcontractors almost guarantees that implementation of this rule will result in claims and disputes.

                         One respondent commented that DoD should clarify whether or not the rule applies to embedded processing, whether the rule applies to cloud computing acquisitions, and whether cloud computing acquisitions are covered procurement actions as a class, since these types of acquisitions are not directly addressed in the interim rule.

                         Three respondents commented that the final rule should encourage industry to better manage supply chain risk, require that robust supply chain risk management principles be applied throughout procurement practices, or at the very least require that contracting officers apply supply chain risk management to contracts. One of these respondents further commented that the final rule should include language that reinforces the stated objective in the definition of supply chain risk, stating, &ldquo;This rule, by itself, does not require contractors to deploy additional supply chain risk protections, but leaves it up to individual contractors to take the steps necessary. . .to protect their supply chain.&rdquo; Another of these respondents suggested that, if the provisions of section 806 are to be implemented as intended, the rule must require robust supply chain analyses. One respondent suggested that the interim rule should provide that in all critical information technology acquisitions, supply chain security must be applied by the relevant Government procurement managers, both at the direct contract and supervisorial levels as a mandatory matter.

One of these respondents commented that the rule creates uncertainty by failing to describe how supply chain risk will be used as an evaluation factor and suggests that the Government must realize that when managing risk, the steps necessary to exhaustively test all software to eliminate all potential unwanted functions is unaffordable. One respondent commented that the new requirement at DFARS 215.304 for departments and agencies to consider &ldquo;the need for an evaluation factor regarding supply chain risk&rdquo; provides insufficient guidance as to the type of supply chain risk evaluation factors to be utilized, further stating that while they would expect that such risk evaluations would be conducted on a case-by-case basis, guidance should be provided as to which evaluation factors should be used and when.

                         In the final rule, guidance on the use of an evaluation factor regarding supply chain risk is modified to require the inclusion of the evaluation factor when acquiring information technology, whether as a service or as a supply, that is a covered system, is a part of a covered system, or is in support of a covered system. Risk levels, risk tolerance, and appropriate risk management measures must be determined at the local level. Evaluation factors are specified at the individual acquisition level and not in the DFARS. DoD is issuing DFARS Procedures, Guidance, and Information for the contracting workforce on developing and using supply chain risk evaluation factors.

One of these respondents urged the DoD to use its discretion in sharing information concerning threats sufficient to allow suppliers to alter product designs and change components on devices to overcome known vulnerabilities. Another respondent suggested that a requirement to report identified supply chain risks and issues would assure that immediate remediation could be undertaken if problems arose. One respondent commented that DoD should consider revising the rule to promote disclosure of information regarding supply chain risks to offerors and contractors whenever possible. Whenever such notice may be accomplished &ldquo;consistent with the requirements of national security,&rdquo; DoD should provide notification to the offeror or contractor of perceived supply chain risks early in the procurement process in accordance with standard Government procurement rules (
                        <em>e.g.,</em>
                         during discussions in a negotiated procurement), so that the contractor has the opportunity to mitigate or eliminate the risk. Contractors are less able to mitigate supply chain risk if the Government fails or declines to share with them risk information it has developed internally.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         Several respondents commented on the need for DoD to focus on mitigation plans and less intrusive measures. One of these respondents commented that DoD should create a mechanism for vendors to file supply chain risk mitigation plans with DoD. DoD could take these plans into consideration when assessing supply chain risk for any particular procurement activity. By viewing filed mitigation plans from multiple vendors, DoD could gain greater insight into commercially viable supply chain mitigation practices. This respondent further stated that DoD should approach supply chain risk with an eye toward encouraging mitigation rather than simply disqualifying vendors, suggesting that DoD can and should implement robust supply chain security practices. One respondent suggested that DoD should clarify what it believes are less intrusive measures under section 239.7304(b)(1)(2), recommending that in order to prevent the interim rule from impeding the use of commercial technology (including commercially available off-the-shelf items) in NSS, which ultimately benefits DoD, the Department should provide wide discretion to the judgment of manufacturers in their use of industry standards and internal processes to meet its supply chain risk goals. This respondent further commented that while DFARS section 239.7304 of the rule provides that an exclusion under DFARS 239.7305 may occur when it is determined that, among other factors, &ldquo;less intrusive measures are not reasonably available to reduce such supply chain risk,&rdquo; at no point in the rule is clarity provided on what this language is defined as or what an authorized individual should refer to in order to gauge what &ldquo;less intrusive measures&rdquo; are and whether they are &ldquo;not reasonably available.&rdquo; Another of these respondents suggested that the opportunity to mitigate or eliminate the noticed risk from the supply chain would avoid significant costs that would be passed along to DoD. One respondent suggested that DoD modify the interim rule to clarify that the exercise of the authorities under DFARS 239.7305 should be a &ldquo;last resort,&rdquo; invoked only after other methods of mitigating supply chain risk have been considered or attempted.

                         Section 806(b)(2) requires that &ldquo;less intrusive measures are not reasonably available to reduce supply chain risk&rdquo; to use its authority. Whenever it is appropriate, DoD will work with its offerors to mitigate supply chain risk using less intrusive measures than exclusion based on section 806 authorities. In the notification to congressional committees when exercising section 806 authority, a summary of the mitigation analysis evaluating reasonably available mitigations will be documented. In most cases, DoD expects these mitigations will sufficiently mitigate the risks so that exclusion will not be necessary.

                         Several respondents commented on the need for the rule to specify relevant supply chain risk management (SCRM) standards, controls, etc. One respondent stated that while it does not suggest DoD explicitly endorse one set of controls over another, industry does need some guidance beyond &ldquo;maintain controls.&rdquo; There must be consistency in the call out of the relevant SCRM standards and ratings in solicitations so as not to create an unnecessary administrative burden for contractors to select suppliers and subcontractors based on a moving target of standards and ratings. Notwithstanding making a reference to the Regulatory Flexibility Act on page 69269 in the narrative of the 
                        <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                         document that the rule &ldquo;recognizes the need for information technology contractors to implement appropriate safeguards and countermeasures to minimize supply chain risk,&rdquo; one respondent commented that the interim rule does not provide any guidance about what metric will be applied to its products, services, and business models. The respondent further stated that the rule requires contractors to &ldquo;maintain controls in the provision of supplies and services to the Government to minimize supply chain risk&rdquo; but does not provide any guidance to contractors or Government contracting officers as to the type of controls to be maintained to meet this requirement, recommending that DoD issue additional guidance that uses existing and proposed global, consensus-based standards. One respondent commented that the absence of what standard DoD will use to evaluate supply chain risks is likely to increase the time and cost of pursuing and performing Government contracts.

                         Two respondents commented on the exclusions process itself. One respondent commented that the exclusion process is seriously flawed because it does not connect the acts conducted by those at higher levels in DoD with the actions of the contracting officers in any rational time phased application that would help offerors understand the proposal and business risk involved in any given source selection process. This respondent further commented that it is fundamentally unclear whether an exclusion will be made on a case-by-case basis or be a blanket exclusion of a contractor or subcontractor, and that it is unclear at what point in the acquisition process such exclusions may be authorized or executed. Under the new rule's language, a source could be excluded before, during, and/or after a contract award (whether as prime or subcontractor). One respondent suggests that its concerns that DoD can reject or modify acquisitions based upon concerns about supply chain integrity could be addressed by having any sensitive finding subject to review, and recommendation for approval or disapproval to the Secretary of Defense, by the DoD General Counsel, or a committee appointed by the Secretary of Defense charged with assuring the validity of such concerns and their sensitivity for release to suppliers.

This respondent further stated that DoD should provide some dispute mechanism for exclusion in protest and claim matters, whereby counsel for offerors, contractors, and proposed subcontractors can represent their clients and obtain access to information under protective order or clearance to assure that the required process was followed and proper grounds for invocation of the exclusion exist.

One of the respondents commented that while DFARS 239.7305 allows DoD to exclude sources, it does not provide a pathway to reinstatement or for inclusion once a supplier is excluded, proposing that DoD establish a separate rulemaking and coordinate a unified policy with an industry-Government working group to gain insight into how remediation and rejoining the defense industrial base can be accomplished in a responsible manner. This respondent further commented that DoD should provide equitable adjustments and other remedies for prime contractors whose subcontractors are excluded, stating that the new regulations fail to provide relief for prime contractors who must exclude a source through no fault of its own. Another respondent suggested that a periodic review of excluded contractors should be required for ongoing contracts with new task orders, adding that if a vendor has been excluded without notice, the interim rule should require the agency to review that decision on no less than an annual basis for as long as the contract is in place. This respondent also commented that the regulation should specifically afford remedies, including equitable adjustments, whenever the authority at DFARS 239.7305(c) is exercised and a prime must exclude a subcontractor.

This is particularly true in the system integration context where the program office and the prime contractors are more likely to have the time and clearances to develop tailored mitigations. Where appropriate, DoD will partner with its contractors to mitigate supply chain risk in lieu of executing section 806 authorities. In most cases, non-806 mitigations will sufficiently manage the risk; when that is not the case and exclusion of a source is required, DoD does not intend to provide equitable adjustments or other remedies.

One of these respondents commented that the rule creates costs beyond the supply chain risk management a responsible company would undertake in the course of ordinary business. Further, the scope of application of the interim rule, which requires compliance at all levels of the DoD supply chain, would require significant, costly, additional investments in supplier management and compliance mechanisms by industry. Another respondent suggested that absent a public comment period before implementation of the rule, industry has no opportunity to provide input regarding the costs and benefits of the approach DoD has taken. One respondent commented that the cumulative economic effect of the exclusion of any one company from any one contract would result in reductions in both Government and commercial business, and the loss of employment at the excluded company and the corresponding loss of payroll. Other losses would be incurred as a result of the ripple effect on primes, subcontractors, or suppliers to the excluded company, which will lose that source of supply and must then incur the expense of identifying and vetting new sources. One respondent commented that by not advising what standard DoD will use to evaluate supply chain risks, the interim rule is likely to increase the time and cost of pursuing and performing Government contracts.

                         DoD does not expect the rule to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of entities. Companies have an existing interest in having a supply chain that they can rely on to provide it with material and supplies that allow the contractor to ultimately supply its customers with products that are safe and that do not impose threats or risks to Government information systems. The rule does not require contractors to deploy additional supply chain risk protections. Section 806 authority applies to a specific contract, task order, or delivery order only.

                         Three respondents commented that the interim rule should provide more guidance regarding the qualification standard(s) that may be established to reduce supply chain risk. One respondent urged DoD to develop the systems and data security requirements for covered procurements and issue them to potential offerors during the procurement process as a requirement for bid eligibility. This approach would focus the use of this clause to procurements for covered systems or covered items of supply and would increase competition by limiting unnecessary disqualification of offerors (and contractors and subcontractors/suppliers) that could meet the Government's requirements. Another respondent commented that the rule should be amended to provide more specificity as to the type of &ldquo;qualification standards&rdquo; that may be established &ldquo;for the purposes of reducing supply chain risk in the acquisition of covered systems.&rdquo;

                         DoD has no present plans to use section 806 authority to exclude a source based on failure to meet a qualification standard to reduce supply chain risk.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         Five respondents requested that DoD harmonize the requirements of the rule with industry- and Government-led supply chain risk management regimes and initiatives in order to avoid inconsistencies. One respondent encouraged DoD to harmonize the requirements of the rule with the guidance issued by the Secretary of Defense memorandum dated October 10, 2013, entitled &ldquo;Safeguarding Unclassified Controlled Technical Information;&rdquo; the Office of Management and Budget's circular M-14-13 dated November 18, 2013, entitled &ldquo;Enhancing the Security of Federal Information and Information Systems;&rdquo; and other Departmental requirements. This respondent further recommends that the final rule include a statement that &ldquo;the rule complements rather than conflicts with other related requirements.&rdquo; Another respondent further encouraged DoD to avoid the creation of unneeded duplication of certifications of these important assurance efforts, by affirming that the interim rule shall not impact the duties of contractors and vendors in assessing relevant procurements related to NSS.

                         DoD is involved in a myriad of efforts to address supply chain risks, specifically, as well as cybersecurity broadly. All of these policies and strategic efforts aim to improve the overall risk posture of the Federal Government's information systems and those of its industry partners. A patchwork of policies and regulations is sometimes necessary to address the variabilities of the system ownership and operation, and the risk tolerance of the mission. The rule is specific to DoD and narrowly scoped to NSS, which often have a lower risk tolerance due to the criticality of missions utilizing such systems.

                        <em>et seq.,</em>
                         and is summarized as follows:
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-78" data-page="67250">The objective of this final rule is to implement in the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement protection against risks to the supply chain affecting National Security Systems (NSS). The legal basis for this final rule is section 806 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) of 2011 (Pub. L. 111.383), as amended by section 806 of the NDAA for FY 2013 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/112/public/239" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 112-239</a>). Congress has recognized a growing concern for risks to the supply chain for technology contracts supporting the Department of Defense (DoD). Congress has defined supply chain risk as the risk that an adversary may sabotage, maliciously introduce unwanted function, or otherwise subvert the design, integrity, manufacturing, production, distribution, installation, operation, or maintenance of a covered system so as to surveil, deny, disrupt, or otherwise degrade the function, use, or operation of such system (see 806(e)(4) of <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/111/public/383" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 111-383</a>).</p>
                    <p id="p-79" data-page="67250">This final rule calls for contractors providing information technology to DoD, whether as a service or as a supply, that is a covered system, is a part of a covered system, or is in support of a covered system, to mitigate supply chain risk to the supplies and services being provided to the Government. It also enables agencies to exclude sources identified as having a supply chain risk from consideration for award of a covered contract, in order to minimize the potential risk for supplies and services purchased by DoD to maliciously degrade the integrity and operation of sensitive information technology systems. Ultimately, DoD anticipates significant savings to taxpayers by reducing the risk of unsafe products entering our supply chain, which pose serious threats or risks to sensitive government information technology systems.</p>
                    <p id="p-80" data-page="67250">No comments were received in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis.</p>
                    <p id="p-81" data-page="67250">This rule applies to contractors providing the Government with information technology that qualifies as a covered system or covered item of supply. This includes purchases of commercial items, including commercial off-the-shelf items, and contracts not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold. While it is not possible to estimate the number of small businesses impacted, DoD does not expect this final rule to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of contractors, since (1) the rule applies only when acquiring information technology that is part of a covered system or in support of a covered system and (2) the authority provided by the rule is expected to be invoked very infrequently.</p>
                    <p id="p-82" data-page="67250">This rule does not require any specific reporting, recordkeeping or compliance requirements.</p>
                    <p id="p-83" data-page="67250">No significant economic impact on small businesses is anticipated; however, the final rule does have a modified applicability for the provision and clause created by the rule. Instead of being prescribed for all information technology acquisitions the provision and clause will only apply to acquisitions for information technology that is a covered system or covered item of supply. This will significantly reduce the number of acquisitions to which the provision and clause will apply.</p>
