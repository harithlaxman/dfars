                        DoD, GSA, and NASA published a proposed rule at <a href="/citation/83-FR-62540" class="fr-reference" data-reference="83 FR 62540">83 FR 62540</a> on December 4, 2018, to implement regulatory changes made by the Small Business Administration (SBA) in its final rule published in the 
                        <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                         at <a href="/citation/81-FR-34243" class="fr-reference" data-reference="81 FR 34243">81 FR 34243</a> on May 31, 2016, which became effective on June 30, 2016. SBA's final rule implements the statutory requirements of section 1651 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2013 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/15/657s" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15 U.S.C. 657s</a>). Section 1651 revised and standardized the limitations on subcontracting, including the nonmanufacturer rule, that apply to small business concerns under FAR part 19. Twenty-nine respondents submitted comments on the proposed rule.

                    <p id="p-7" data-page="44233">The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council (the Councils) reviewed the public comments in the development of the final rule.

<em>The definition of &ldquo;similarly situated entity&rdquo;.</em>
                         The definition of &ldquo;similarly situated entity&rdquo; is revised at FAR 19.001 and in FAR clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting. It now provides an example of entities having the same small business program status and to specify that the entity must be small under the size standard associated with the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code the prime contractor assigned to the subcontract.

<em>Applicable dollar threshold.</em>
                         The final rule reflects the clarification that the nonmanufacturer rule and the limitations on subcontracting apply to set-asides and sole source awards made pursuant to subparts 19.8, 19.13, 19.14, and 19.15, as well as awards using the HUBZone price evaluation preference pursuant to subpart 19.13, regardless of dollar value.

Paragraph (h)(1)(ii)(B) is added to specify that the contracting officer shall insert the clause at FAR 52.219-33, Nonmanufacturer Rule, in solicitations and contracts when the HUBZone price evaluation preference is used. For the FAR clauses at 52.219-14 and 52.219-33, the prescription also states that the contracting officer shall not insert the clause in the resultant contract if the prospective contractor waived the use of the price evaluation preference or is an other than small business.</p>

                        this clause applies to contracts using the HUBZone price evaluation preference to award to a HUBZone small business concern unless the concern waived the evaluation preference.

                         &ldquo;mixed contracts&rdquo;), paragraph (e)(1) of the clause at FAR 52.219-14 is revised to specify that when a contract is assigned a NAICS code for services, the 50 percent limitation shall only apply to the services portion of the contract. Paragraph (e)(2) is revised to specify that when a contract is assigned a NAICS code for supplies, the 50 percent limitation shall only apply to the supply portion of the contract.

Paragraph (c)(2) is revised to remove text concerning an item for a kit that is not produced by small business concerns in the United States or its outlying areas.

<em>Revisions to include recent FAR changes.</em>
                         Prior to publication of this final rule, FAR part 19 and its associated provisions and clauses were substantially revised as a result of FAC 2020-05 (published February 27, 2020, and effective March 30, 2020). As a result, some revisions in the proposed rule are no longer included in this final rule, because the revisions have already been made to the FAR in FAC 2020-05. Other revisions appear in a different location due to the changed landscape of FAR part 19. The final rule also contains revisions that were not in the proposed rule due to changes made in FAC 2020-05. For example, prior to March 30, 2020, the FAR did not include coverage of the limitations on subcontracting and nonmanufacturer rule in subparts 19.8, 19.13, 19.14, and 19.15; FAC 2020-05 added coverage tailored for each of those subparts. Due to the standardization of the limitations on subcontracting and nonmanufacturer rule, this final rule removes the coverage from those subparts and consolidates the coverage in subpart 19.5. In addition, as of March 30, 2020, FAR part 19 includes coverage for orders issued directly to one small business under a reserve. This final rule provides guidance on the applicability of the limitations on subcontracting and nonmanufacturer rule for this new topic.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         Several respondents expressed disappointment at the time it took to publish the proposed rule. More specifically, two respondents noted that it had taken over 2 years to publish the proposed rule. One respondent requested immediate implementation of the rule by means of a class deviation for the civilian agencies or an &ldquo;interim final rule,&rdquo; noting that it is burdensome for small businesses if one agency has a class deviation in place while others do not. Another respondent also requested issuance of an &ldquo;interim final rule&rdquo; and recommended that the FAR Council coordinate with SBA on SBA's pending rulemaking and issue its own final rule that matches SBA's final rule.

                        <em>Response:</em>
                         The Councils acknowledge the length of time between the opening of FAR case 2016-011 and publication of the proposed rule. More time was required to publish the proposed rule due to changes in the rulemaking process that occurred in 2017 to more fully consider the regulatory or deregulatory impact of the rulemaking. The Councils have taken steps to try to shorten the time required to implement SBA's rules in the FAR. Beginning in 2019, the Councils started working on proposed FAR rules after SBA publishes a proposed rule, instead of waiting for a final rule from SBA. This approach should allow more timely publication of FAR rules implementing SBA rules.

                         Two respondents pointed out that the proposed text for FAR 52.219-4(e) does not account for the joint venture options afforded to HUBZone small business concerns under SBA's regulations and requires further revisions to bring the clause into alignment with SBA's limitations on subcontracting rules for HUBZone joint ventures. Specifically, the respondents are concerned the SBA's requirement that a HUBZone joint venture partner perform 40 percent of the joint venture's work, is not being addressed.

                         A separate FAR case, 2017-019, Policy on Joint Ventures, will address the respondents' concern. The final rule will address the policy that a HUBZone joint venture partner must perform 40 percent of the joint venture's work.

                        <em>Comment:</em>
                         One respondent stated that the clause at FAR 52.219-4 places HUBZone distributors at a significant disadvantage by effectively preventing them from taking advantage of the HUBZone price evaluation preference, because it is not possible for a HUBZone nonmanufacturer to obtain a waiver of the nonmanufacturer rule from SBA for a full-and-open contract. The respondent also stated that the HUBZone nonmanufacturer should be permitted to supply a product of any business when utilizing the HUBZone price evaluation preference. The respondent further stated that if the clause at FAR 52.219-4 continues to require full compliance with the nonmanufacturer rule for HUBZone distributors, then the waiver rules must be modified to permit SBA to issue a waiver of the nonmanufacturer rule, upon request of a HUBZone firm, for a full and open contract when the price evaluation preference is utilized. The respondent further stated that if HUBZone distributors are not permitted to supply products of any size business, the clause at FAR 52.219-4 should be modified to permit HUBZone distributors to provide products of any type of small business rather than the current requirement to supply products made by other HUBZone small businesses.

The Councils have updated the final rule at FAR 19.507(e) and (h) to clarify that solicitations and contracts using the HUBZone price evaluation preference to award to a HUBZone small business concern must include the FAR clauses at 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, and 52.219-33, Nonmanufacturer Rule. The Councils have also updated the paragraphs entitled &ldquo;Applicability&rdquo; in these clauses to clarify their applicability to contracts awarded to a HUBZone small business concern using the HUBZone price evaluation preference and that the limitations on subcontracting and nonmanufacturer rule do not apply if the price evaluation preference is waived by the offeror.

                         The FAR does not direct subcontracting decisions of prime contractors. Additionally, SBA's regulation does not provide that a prime contractor must compete a subcontract before it can award a subcontract, whether or not the award is to a similarly situated entity. This final rule will not be revised to incorporate the requested language as the rule is consistent with SBA's regulations.

                         One respondent acknowledged the proposed rule properly provides that first-tier subcontracts awarded to a &ldquo;similarly situated entity&rdquo; are excluded from the calculation of the 50 percent subcontract amount that cannot be exceeded. However, the respondent points out, the clauses then provide that all work further subcontracted by such similarly situated entity does count toward the 50 percent subcontract amount that cannot be exceeded. The respondent believes this formulation creates an inconsistency among small business programs and an administrative burden for prime contractors and urges that this further limitation be deleted.

                         SBA's regulation at <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-13/section-125.6#p-125.6(c)" class="cfr external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">13 CFR 125.6(c)</a> limits similarly situated entities to the first-tier subcontractors. Therefore, this final rule also contains this limitation. Determining compliance with the limitations on subcontracting by including in the calculation subcontracts beyond the prime contractor and first-tier subcontractor creates the possibility that the first-tier subcontractor may subcontract 100% of the work it received from the prime to an entity that is not similarly situated. This would create a loophole for entities that are not small business concerns and would not have qualified to receive the prime contract, to benefit as subcontractors from Government contracts that are set aside for performance by small business concerns. To address these concerns, SBA's regulations apply the limitations on subcontracting collectively to the prime and any similarly situated first-tier subcontractor. Any work performed by a similarly situated first-tier subcontractor will count toward compliance with the applicable limitation on subcontracting. For purposes of determining whether the prime and its subcontractor complied with the applicable limitation on subcontracting, work that is not performed by the employees of the prime contractor or employees of first-tier similarly situated subcontractors will count as subcontracts performed by non-similarly situated entities. Using similarly situated subcontractors gives the prime contractor greater flexibility but does require monitoring and oversight by the prime contractor to ensure the benefits flow to the intended recipients. The final rule has been revised at FAR 52.219-14 to provide additional clarity on this issue.

                         A prime contractor may subcontract more than 50 percent of the work to a similarly situated entity and still comply with the limitations on subcontracting. SBA's regulation at <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-13/section-125.6#p-125.6(c)" class="cfr external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">13 CFR 125.6(c)</a> provides three examples to illustrate when the prime contractor meets, or fails to meet, the limitations on subcontracting. One example describes an award for supplies to a service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) that subcontracts to a similarly situated entity for 51 percent of the work, which does not violate the limitations on subcontracting. However, any work that the similarly situated entity further subcontracts will be counted toward the 50 percent subcontract limit.

                         The Councils do not concur with this comment. Section 1651 of the NDAA for FY 2013 is silent on its applicability to commercial and COTS items. The corresponding final rule implemented by the SBA in its regulation did not exempt acquisitions of commercial or COTS items from the limitations on subcontracting. Further, the revisions to the limitations on subcontracting reflected in this final FAR rule actually facilitate access to the Federal marketplace for small businesses, simplify the process of tracking costs spent by prime contractors on subcontractors, and make the application of limitations on subcontracting consistent across the small business programs. Exclusion of acquisitions for commercial and COTS items will limit the full realization of these improvements for small businesses and hinder their participation in Federal procurements as both prime contractors and subcontractors.

                         The rule does not restrict small business subcontracting opportunities nor does it discourage subcontracting arrangements. Rather, the proposed rule provides small businesses with greater flexibility in how they choose to comply with the limitations on subcontracting. Moreover, the new rules make it easier for small business prime contractors to do business with Federal agencies by giving them more choices that are less burdensome and less costly for pursuing and winning larger contracts than before. The rule implements an SBA final rule intended to ensure that the benefits of set-aside contracts flow to the intended beneficiaries. The recommended elimination of all limitations on subcontracting is counter to that intent and is beyond the scope of this rule.

                         The prescriptions for the clauses at FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, and 52.219-33, Nonmanufacturer Rule, specify use of the clauses when &ldquo;any portion of the requirement is set aside for small business and is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold&rdquo;. The prescriptions also specify use of the clauses in multiple-award contracts when orders may be set aside for small business because the clauses apply to orders that are set aside for small business under multiple-award contracts. The applicability of the limitations on subcontracting and the nonmanufacturer rule is determined partly by whether the contract or the order is being set aside for small business. If an order is set aside for small business, the clause applies to the order if it exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold (see 52.219-14(c)(4) and 52.219-33(b)(2)(iii)). Alternatively, if a multiple-award contract is set aside for small business, the clause applies to the contract if it exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold.

                         One respondent stated DoD Class Deviation 2019-O0003, Limitations on Subcontracting for Small Business, contains a requirement stating, if the contract falls below the SAT, it is not a complete waiver of the nonmanufacturer rule because the small business must still provide the end item of any domestic firm. The respondent noted this same requirement is not present in the current SBA regulations, nor in the current proposed rule change and encourages the Councils to proceed with issuing a final rule that does not include this restriction. A second respondent recommended that clear definitions of subcontract and subcontractor should be provided to regulate the use of independent contractors (consultants) and ancillary services, as well as to formulate policies and mechanisms with respect to consent to subcontract, flow down of contract provisions, and other FAR requirements. A third respondent asked if the proposed regulation would take precedence over a specified agency's clause.

                         HUBZone, 8(a), service-disabled veteran-owned, and women-owned small business programs) by ensuring these benefits extend to the many contracts valued below the SAT. According to the Federal Procurement Data System, an average of 283,374 contracts per year resulted from FAR part 19 set-asides and sole-source awards at or below the simplified acquisition threshold during fiscal years 2016-2018. Failure to apply section 1651 below the SAT would exclude a significant number of acquisitions, contrary to the goal of promoting opportunities for small businesses in the Federal marketplace to the maximum extent possible. Further, the FAR clauses imposing limitations on subcontracting and the nonmanufacturer rule are currently prescribed for use in solicitations and contracts at or below the SAT that are set aside for, or awarded on a sole-source basis to, 8(a) program participants, HUBZone, service-disabled veteran-owned, women-owned, or economically disadvantaged women-owned small business concerns; or that use the HUBZone price evaluation preference to award to a HUBZone small business concern. Making section 1651 applicable to acquisitions at or below the SAT would allow the amended versions of those clauses, reflecting the requirements of section 1651, to be incorporated into such solicitations and contracts. Exclusion of the amended clauses from those documents would create confusion among contractors and the Federal contracting workforce. Finally, under the FAR clauses currently incorporated into those documents, contractors are already required to comply with the limitations on subcontracting and the nonmanufacturer rule. The new requirements will result in substantial savings for contractors.

                    <p id="p-75" data-page="44239">The law furthers the Administration's goal of simplifying the acquisition process and facilitating easier access to the Federal marketplace, in this case for small business contractors who make up an important component of the Government's industrial base. It advances the interests of small business prime contractors by making it easier to comply with the limitations on subcontracting, potentially allowing those contractors to compete for larger contracts than they could in the past. The law also advances the interests of small business subcontractors by encouraging small business prime contractors to award more subcontracts to similarly situated small businesses. Exclusion of a large segment of Federal contracting, such as acquisitions for commercial items, would limit the full implementation of these objectives. Further, the primary FAR clauses implementing the limitations on subcontracting and the nonmanufacturer rule are currently prescribed for use in solicitations and contracts for commercial items. Making section 1651 applicable to acquisitions for commercial items would allow the amended versions of those clauses, reflecting the requirements of section 1651, to be included in such solicitations and contracts. Exclusion of those amended clauses from contracts for commercial items would create confusion among contractors and the Federal contracting workforce. Finally, the burden on contractors would not increase significantly if the requirements of section 1651 were applied to acquisitions for commercial items.

                    <p id="p-81" data-page="44239">The law furthers the Administration's goal of simplifying the acquisition process and facilitating easier access to the Federal marketplace, in this case for small business contractors who make up an important component of the Government's industrial base. It advances the interests of small business prime contractors by making it easier to comply with the limitations on subcontracting, potentially allowing those contractors to compete for larger contracts than they could in the past. The law also advances the interests of small business subcontractors by encouraging small business prime contractors to award more subcontracts to similarly situated small businesses. Exclusion of a large segment of Federal contracting, such as acquisitions for COTS items, would limit the full implementation of these objectives. Further, FAR clauses imposing limitations on subcontracting and the nonmanufacturer rule are currently prescribed for use in solicitations and contracts for COTS items. Making section 1651 applicable to acquisitions of COTS items would allow the amended versions of those clauses, reflecting the requirements of section 1651, to be incorporated into such solicitations and contracts. Exclusion of the amended clauses from those documents would create confusion among contractors and the Federal contracting workforce. Finally, the burden on contractors would not increase significantly if the requirements of section 1651 were applied to acquisitions for COTS items. Under the FAR clauses currently incorporated into contracts for those items, contractors are already required to comply with the limitations on subcontracting and the nonmanufacturer rule. The new requirements will result in substantial savings for contractors.</p>
                    <p id="p-82" data-page="44239">For these reasons, it is in the best interest of the Federal Government to apply the requirements of the rule to the acquisition of COTS items.</p>

                    <p id="p-83" data-page="44239">
                        The purpose of this rule is to implement statutory authorities and SBA regulations that are designed to make it easier and less burdensome for small business prime contractors to comply with requirements related to how much work they may subcontract under Federal contracts, including task and delivery orders under those contracts (
                        <em>i.e.,</em>
                         the &ldquo;limitations on subcontracting&rdquo;). The changes to these requirements would both ease compliance costs and provide more authorized ways to subcontract. Section 1651 of the NDAA for FY 2013 revised and standardized the limitations on subcontracting, including the nonmanufacturer rule. The nonmanufacturer rule is the requirement that the prime contractor, who is a reseller of a product (
                        <em>i.e.,</em>
                         a &ldquo;nonmanufacturer&rdquo;), provide an end product manufactured by a small business in the United States or its outlying areas. The limitations on subcontracting and the nonmanufacturer rule are meant to

                        ensure that the benefits of contracts and orders awarded to small businesses flow to the intended beneficiaries.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-84" data-page="44240">Prior to section 1651, the limitations on subcontracting and the nonmanufacturer rule were inconsistent across the small business programs. For example, under the 8(a) and WOSB Programs, the prime contractor was required to perform a certain percentage of work itself, whereas under the HUBZone and SDVOSB Programs, the prime contractor could include subcontracts to other HUBZone small business or SDVOSB concerns in the percentage of work it performed. Similarly, with regard to the nonmanufacturer rule, a prime contractor for a contract or order set aside or awarded on a sole-source basis under the HUBZone Program was required to provide products manufactured by another HUBZone small business, but for awards under the other small business programs, the prime contractor was required to provide products manufactured by any small business.</p>
                    <p id="p-85" data-page="44240">
                        In addition, the basis of the limitations on subcontracting has changed. Prior to section 1651, the limitations on subcontracting were calculated as a percentage of work to be performed by a prime contractor; the calculation was based on the contractor's costs to perform the contract (
                        <em>e.g.,</em>
                         salaries and other allowable costs under FAR part 31). As a result of section 1651, the limitations on subcontracting will be calculated as a percentage of the overall contract or order amount (
                        <em>i.e.,</em>
                         the contract price, including costs and profit or fee) to be spent by the prime contractor on subcontractors. As a result, for the purpose of compliance with the limitations on subcontracting the prime contractor no longer has to track the percentage of costs incurred that it spends performing work itself. It only has to track the percentage of the overall award amount (
                        <em>i.e.,</em>
                         contract price) that it spends on subcontractors. For small businesses, this change will reduce the burden associated with tracking and documenting compliance with the limitations on subcontracting.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-86" data-page="44240">Section 1651 also applied the concept of &ldquo;similarly situated entities&rdquo; to all small business programs. A similarly situated entity is a small business subcontractor that has the same small business program status as that which qualified the prime contractor for the prime contract. The percentage of the contract or order amount that the prime contractor spends on subcontractors who are similarly situated entities is not considered subcontracted for purposes of compliance with the limitations on subcontracting. Prior to section 1651, small businesses that wanted to work together to comply with the limitations on subcontracting were required to form a joint venture or a new legal entity (except in small business programs where the concept of similarly situated entities was already applied). The concept of similarly situated entities eliminates the need for paperwork, coordination, and other costs associated with forming such a joint venture or new legal entity simply to comply with the limitations on subcontracting.</p>
                    <p id="p-87" data-page="44240">These important changes allow small businesses greater flexibility on how they choose to comply with the limitations on subcontracting. The impact is illustrated in the following example of a non-construction contract:</p>

                    <p id="p-88" data-page="44240">Under the current limitations on subcontracting, the small business only has one way to comply. In the example above, it must spend at least $400 on its own employees and, therefore, must be able to track its contract costs to ensure compliance with the requirement. Under the new limitations on subcontracting, there are multiple and less costly ways to comply, and the small business can choose the most efficient option, as demonstrated below:</p>
                    
            <ul class="bullets" >
          <li id="p-89" data-page="44240">The small business can continue to spend $400 on its own employees and subcontract $400 to any business, as it did to comply with the previous limitations on subcontracting. Because the prime contractor is not subcontracting more than $500 to businesses that are not similarly situated entities, it will meet the new limitations on subcontracting.</li>
                    <li id="p-90" data-page="44240">The small business can subcontract to any combination of similarly situated and non-similarly situated entities and remain in compliance with the new limitations on subcontracting as long as the amount spent on non-similarly situated entities does not exceed $500. For example, the small business can subcontract $500 to any business and spend $300 on its own employees, or subcontract $500 to any business, $100 to a similarly situated entity, and spend only $200 on its own employees.</li>
            </ul>
          
                    <p id="p-91" data-page="44240">SBA's final rule specified that similarly situated entities must also comply with the limitations on subcontracting. As part of implementing section 1651, the SBA made a few more revisions to their regulations that are reflected in this FAR rule:</p>
                    
            <ul class="bullets" >
          <li id="p-92" data-page="44240">The nonmanufacturer rule does not apply to small business set-asides at or below the simplified acquisition threshold. Note that currently, the FAR applies the nonmanufacturer rule to small business set-asides above $25,000.</li>
                    <li id="p-93" data-page="44240">Waivers of the nonmanufacturer rule will now be allowed for procurements under the HUBZone Program. Such waivers allow a HUBZone small business to provide the product of any size business.</li>
                    <li id="p-94" data-page="44240">In the event SBA grants a nonmanufacturer rule waiver after the issuance of a solicitation, but before award, contracting officers are required to amend that solicitation to notify potential offerors of the waiver and to give them more time to submit proposals.</li>
            </ul>
          
                    <p id="p-95" data-page="44240">The above changes drive both costs and savings; however, the rule is expected to result in net savings to small entities, as well as to the Government. Since the rule will only revise regulations under the various small business programs, there will be no costs or savings to large businesses. The expected net savings of the rule, calculated at present value using a 7-percent discount rate over ten years, is estimated to be $189,298,957.</p>

                             at <a href="/citation/81-FR-34243" class="fr-reference" data-reference="81 FR 34243">81 FR 34243</a> on May 31, 2016. SBA's final rule implements the statutory requirements of section 1651 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2013, which revised and standardized the limitations on subcontracting, including the nonmanufacturer rule, that apply to small business concerns under FAR part 19 procurements.

                        <p id="p-101" data-page="44241">The objectives of this rule are to apply the limitations on subcontracting consistently to the small business concerns identified in FAR 19.000(a)(3) and to change the method of calculation to the percentage of the award amount to be spent on subcontractors.</p>
                        <p id="p-102" data-page="44241">There were no significant issues raised by the public in response to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis.</p>
                        <p id="p-103" data-page="44241">This rule may have a positive economic impact on small businesses, because it will make application of the limitations on subcontracting and the nonmanufacturer rule uniform across all small business programs and make it easier to calculate compliance with the limitations on subcontracting. Through the ability to meet the limitations by means of subcontracts with similarly situated entities, this rule will make it possible for small businesses to compete for larger contracts than they could in the past. The rule will encourage small business prime contractors to award subcontracts to other, similarly situated, small businesses.</p>
                        <p id="p-104" data-page="44241">According to the System for Award Management (SAM), there are 315,655 active registrants that are considered small for at least one North American Industry Classification System code. Firms looking to be prime contractors for Government contracts are required to register in SAM. However, firms do not need to register in SAM to participate in subcontracting. Thus, the number of small business firms impacted by this rule may be greater than the number of firms registered in SAM.</p>
                        <p id="p-105" data-page="44241">This rule does not include any new reporting or recordkeeping requirements for small entities. This rule does not include any new compliance requirements. The FAR already required compliance with the limitations on subcontracting and the nonmanufacturer rule for small business prime contractors receiving awards pursuant to part 19. This rule simply revises the limitations on subcontracting and the nonmanufacturer rule to match that required by section 1651 of the NDAA for FY 2013. According to the Federal Procurement Data System, there were approximately 70,992 contracts per year in fiscal years 2016-2018 under all the small business programs to which the limitations on subcontracting or the nonmanufacturer rule would apply.</p>
