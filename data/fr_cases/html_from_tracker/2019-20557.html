                     A respondent expresses concern that the rule will be interpreted as a complete prohibition on the use of the LPTA source selection process. The respondent recommends revising the rule to clarify that use of the process is acceptable and expand on the circumstances in which it is or is not appropriate for use in acquisitions.

                    <em>Response:</em>
                     It is not the intent of the rule to prohibit the use of the LPTA source selection process. The LPTA source selection process is a valuable part of the best value continuum and an acceptable and appropriate source selection approach for many acquisitions. Instead, the intent of the

                    rule is to implement the statutory language, which aims to identify meaningful circumstances that must exist for an acquisition to use the LPTA source selection process and certain types of requirements that will regularly benefit from the use of tradeoff source selection procedures. If a requirement satisfies the limitations for use of the LPTA source selection process, then the process may be used as a source selection approach. Supplemental information to contracting officers on when and from whom to seek additional guidance on whether a requirement satisfies the limitations at 215.101-2-70(a)(1) will be published in the DFARS Procedures, Guidance, and Information (PGI) in conjunction with this final rule.

                     Training is readily available to DoD personnel on a variety of acquisition topics, including best value decisions. Upon publication of the final rule, the DFARS PGI will be updated to provide contracting officers with information on when and from whom to seek additional guidance when acquiring supplies and services that are impacted by this rule.

                <p id="p-18" data-page="50786">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     Some respondents recommend applying greater restrictions on the types of acquisitions that can use the LPTA source selection process. For example, a respondent suggests revising this rule to only authorize the use of the LPTA source selection process when acquiring goods that are predominantly expendable in nature, non-technical, or have a short shelf life or life expectancy. Another respondent suggests limiting the use of the LPTA source selection process to only commercial and commercial-off-the-shelf items valued at or below the simplified acquisition threshold, while expressly prohibiting its use for all other requirements.
                </p>
                <p id="p-19" data-page="50786">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     To ensure that DoD is not denied the benefit of cost and technical tradeoffs in the source selection process, the rule identifies meaningful circumstances that must exist for an individual requirement to use the LPTA source selection process. Each requirement has a unique set of circumstances that should be considered when developing a source selection approach. The LPTA source selection process is a valuable part of the best value continuum and can be used to facilitate an effective and competitive acquisition approach, depending on the circumstances of the acquisition. Limiting the use of the LPTA source selection process to only goods, commercial items under a specific dollar threshold, or other broadly defined groupings does not fully consider the circumstances of an individual requirement and could result in additional and unnecessary time and cost burdens for both Government and industry.

                <p id="p-20" data-page="50786">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     Some respondents recommend revising the rule to clarify whether each limitation listed at 215.101-2-70(a)(1) applies to supplies, services, or both supplies and services. In particular, a respondent suggests that the rule text be clarified to ensure that the limitations at 215.101-2-70(a)(i) through (iv) are applied to both supplies and services. The respondent also suggests restructuring the rule text by dividing the limitations into two paragraphs: One paragraph that identifies the limitations that apply to the acquisition of supplies, and one that identifies the limitations that apply to the acquisition of services. In contrast, another respondent expresses support for retaining the existing structure of the rule.
                </p>
                <p id="p-21" data-page="50786">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The statutory language being implemented by the rule does not categorize the limitations into those that apply to supplies or services. As a result, the list of limitations at 215.101-2-70(a)(1)(i) through (viii) is written to apply to any acquisition that utilizes the LPTA source selection process. In consideration of these limitations, the contracting officer must document the contract file with a description of the circumstances that justify the use of the LPTA source selection process.
                </p>
                <p id="p-22" data-page="50786">One exception is the limitation at 215.101-2-70(a)(1)(vi), which implements paragraph (a)(3) of section 822 of the NDAA for FY 2018 that states the limitation is &ldquo;with respect to a contract for the procurement of goods;&rdquo; as such, this rule specifically identifies that goods must meet this limitation.</p>

                <p id="p-23" data-page="50786">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     Some respondents suggest that additional criteria be added to the list of limitations in order to satisfy Congressional intent. Specifically, one respondent suggests that &ldquo;non-complex&rdquo; be added to the additional criteria for goods at 215.101-2-70(a)(1)(vi). The respondent also suggests adding another factor to the list that expressly limits the use of LPTA source selection procedures to procurements where the risk of unsuccessful performance is minimal.
                </p>
                <p id="p-24" data-page="50786">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The intent of this rule is to implement the statutory language, which does not include &ldquo;non-complex&rdquo; as a criteria to meet when purchasing goods, or a limitation on acceptable performance risk, when using the LPTA source selection process. Comprehensively, the consideration of each limitation at 215.101-2-70(a)(1) provides an effective evaluation of a requirement's suitability to use of the LPTA source selection process and reflects the intent of the statutory language; therefore, no additional limitation criteria are included in this final rule.

                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     Some respondents indicate that the terms used in the rule are unclear. Specifically, one respondent suggests modifying paragraph 215.101-2-70(a)(1)(ii) to expressly state that &ldquo;value&rdquo; includes both qualitative and quantitative value to be realized by DoD. Another respondent advises that it is unclear what &ldquo;full life-cycle costs&rdquo; means when acquiring services.

                <p id="p-26" data-page="50786">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     Supplemental guidance will be published in DFARS PGI in conjunction with this final rule to assist contracting officers in documenting the contract file with a determination that the lowest price reflects full life-cycle costs. The term &ldquo;value&rdquo; includes monetary and non-monetary benefits, as applicable to the requirement. The term also considers whether DoD is willing to pay more than a minimum price in return for non-monetary benefits (
                    <em>e.g.,</em>
                     greater functionality, higher performance, or lower performance risk). The rule does not place any limitations on the meaning of the term.

                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     A respondent expresses concern that this rule requires a written justification when using the LPTA source selection process.

In contrast, another respondent suggests that this rule expand the documentation requirement to include a description and analysis of the all the requirements at 215.101-2-70(a)(1) in order to justify the use of the LPTA source selection process and require the justification to be posted with the solicitation.

                <p id="p-28" data-page="50787">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     This rule implements statutory language that requires a contracting officer document the contract file with the circumstances justifying the use of the LPTA source selection process. The rule does not specify a format or method to be used to meet this statutory requirement. The appropriate format of the justification and the method of incorporation into the contract file is left to the discretion of each Department or agency. When developing a source selection approach, acquisition personnel consider the unique circumstances of a requirement and determine the method that will result in the best value to DoD. Publicizing the justification with the solicitation is not required by statute and could result in increased cost and time burden to both Government and industry.

                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     One respondent suggests that the two sentences regarding audit services at 215.101-2-70(b)(3) be reversed to state the prohibition upfront and follow with how award decisions shall be made for such services.

                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The primary intent of the text, as arranged, is to address the action a contracting officer shall take when awarding an auditing contract; therefore, no change is made to the final rule.

These sections establish a preference for the use of the tradeoff source selection process for certain safety items and auditing services; prohibit the use of reverse auctions or the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) source selection process for specific supplies and services; and specify criteria for the use of the LPTA source selection process.</p>
                <p id="p-45" data-page="50787">No public comments were received in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis.</p>

                    which 47% were awarded to 5,221 unique small business entities. It is important to note that FPDS does not collect data on the source selection process used for a solicitation. Therefore, this data includes competitive solicitations using LPTA or tradeoff source selection processes, which will be subject to future considerations and restrictions provided by section 813 of the NDAA for FY 2017 and section 822 of the NDAA for FY 2018.

Of those new contracts and orders, 89% were awarded to 668 unique small business entities.
