                    <p id="p-6" data-page="65510">
                        DoD published a proposed rule in the 
                        <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                         at <a href="/citation/87-FR-37470" class="fr-reference" data-reference="87 FR 37470">87 FR 37470</a> on June 23, 2022, to implement section 883 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/116/public/283" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 116-283</a>). Section 883 prohibits the award of a DoD contract to an entity that requires its employees to sign internal confidentiality agreements or statements that would prohibit or otherwise restrict such employees from lawfully reporting waste, fraud, or abuse related to the performance of a DoD contract to a designated investigative or law enforcement representative within DoD authorized to receive such information. The statute also requires entities to inform its employees of the limitations on confidentiality agreements or other statements. Offerors are required to represent compliance with the statutory restrictions in the System for Award Management prior to submitting an offer or quote.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-7" data-page="65510">The requirements of section 883 closely resemble those provided in section 743 of Division E, Title VII, of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/113/public/235" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 113-235</a>), which was implemented at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 3.909, Prohibition on providing funds to an entity that requires certain internal confidentiality agreements or statements (<a href="/citation/82-FR-4717" class="fr-reference" data-reference="82 FR 4717">82 FR 4717</a>, dated January 13, 2017). Since the prohibition at section 743 applies Governmentwide, DoD is currently complying with section 883 based on the FAR application of section 743 to employees and contractors.</p>
                    <p id="p-8" data-page="65510">One respondent submitted a comment in response to the proposed rule.</p>
                    <h2 id="h-8">II. Discussion and Analysis</h2>
                    <p id="p-9" data-page="65510">DoD reviewed the public comment in the development of the final rule. The respondent provided a comment about the definition of the term &ldquo;entity&rdquo; as it pertains to the application of the rule, which is outside of the scope of this rule. No changes were made in the final rule.</p>
                    <h2 id="h-9">III. Applicability to Contracts at or Below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT), for Commercial Products (Including Commercially Available Off-the-Shelf (COTS) Items), and for Commercial Services</h2>
                    <p id="p-10" data-page="65510">This rule implements section 883 of the NDAA for FY 2021 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/116/public/283" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 116-283</a>) but does not create any new solicitation provisions or contract clauses. The rule does apply DFARS clause 252.203-7002, Requirement to Inform Employees of Whistleblower Rights, to contracts valued at or below the SAT and for commercial services and products, including COTS items. The rule, at DFARS 203.909-3, also prescribes use of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provision 52.203-18, Prohibition on Contracting with Entities that Require Certain Internal Confidentiality Agreements or Statements-Representation, and FAR clause 52.203-19, Prohibition on Requiring Certain Internal Confidentiality Agreements or Statements. The FAR clause and provision, except for personal services contracts, are already prescribed for use in acquisitions at or below the SAT; and the FAR clause 52.203-19 is also prescribed for use in commercial acquisitions.</p>
                    <h3 id="h-10">A. Applicability to Contracts at or Below the SAT</h3>
                    <p id="p-11" data-page="65510"><a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1905" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1905</a> governs the applicability of laws to contracts or subcontracts in amounts not greater than the SAT. It is intended to limit the applicability of laws to such contracts or subcontracts. <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1905" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1905</a> provides that if a provision of law contains criminal or civil penalties, or if the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (FAR Council) makes a determination that it is not in the best interest of the Federal Government to exempt contracts or subcontracts at or below the SAT, the law will apply to them. The Principal Director, Defense Pricing and Contracting (DPC), is the appropriate authority to make comparable determinations for regulations to be published in the DFARS, which is part of the FAR system of regulations.</p>
                    <h3 id="h-11">B. Applicability to Contracts for the Acquisition of Commercial Services and Commercial Products, Including COTS Items</h3>

Due to delegations of authority, the Principal Director, DPC is the appropriate authority to make this determination. DoD intends to apply this rule and the corresponding statutes (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2409" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2409</a> and section 883 of the NDAA for FY 2021) to acquisitions at or below the SAT and for commercial services and commercial products, including COTS items.</p>
                    <h3 id="h-12">C. Determination</h3>
                    <p id="p-13" data-page="65510">
                        DoD intends to apply the requirements of <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2409" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2409</a> and section 883 of the NDAA for FY 2021 to contracts at or below the SAT and those awarded under FAR part 12 procedures because the statutory protections are intended to apply to any employee of a contractor or subcontractor who discloses or may be restricted from disclosing evidence of waste, fraud, and abuse. The statutes only exempt the application to elements of the intelligence community.

An employee of a contractor or subcontractor may not be discharged, demoted, or otherwise discriminated against as a reprisal for such a disclosure. The statute does not apply to elements of the intelligence committee.</p>
                    <p id="p-15" data-page="65511">Section 883 prohibits the award of any DoD contract to an entity that requires its employees to sign internal confidentiality agreements or statements that would prohibit or otherwise restrict its employees from lawfully reporting waste, fraud, or abuse related to the performance of a DoD contract to a designated investigative or law enforcement representative of DoD authorized to receive such information.</p>
                    <p id="p-16" data-page="65511">It is not in the best interest of the Federal Government to exempt application of this rule to actions at or below the SAT or to commercial services and commercial products (including COTS items). An exception for contracts at or below the SAT and those for commercial services and commercial products (including COTS items) would exclude the majority of the contracts and individuals intended to be protected under the laws, thereby undermining the overarching public policy purpose of the laws.</p>
                    <h2 id="h-13">IV. Expected Impact of the Rule</h2>
                    <p id="p-17" data-page="65511">This proposed rule is not expected to have a significant impact on the public or Government agencies because the requirements of section 883 have already been implemented Governmentwide at FAR 3.909. DoD-specific implementation of section 883 would duplicate the previous implementation of section 743 of Division E, Title VII, of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/113/public/235" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub.

                    <h2 id="h-14">V. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563</h2>
                    <p id="p-18" data-page="65511">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993.</p>

                    <p id="p-19" data-page="65511">
                        As required by the Congressional Review Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/801" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 801-808</a>) before an interim or final rule takes effect, DoD will submit a copy of the interim or final rule with the form, Submission of Federal Rules Under the Congressional Review Act, to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Comptroller General of the United States. A major rule under the Congressional Review Act cannot take effect until 60 days after it is published in the 
                        <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                        . The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has determined that this rule is not a major rule as defined by <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/804" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 804</a>.

                        A final regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>, 
                        <em>et seq.</em>
                         and is summarized as follows:
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-21" data-page="65511">This rule amends the DFARS to implement section 883 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/116/public/283" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 116-283</a>). Section 883 prohibits the award of a DoD contract to an entity that requires its employees to sign internal confidentiality agreements or statements that would prohibit or otherwise restrict such employees from lawfully reporting waste, fraud, or abuse related to the performance of a DoD contract to a designated investigative or law enforcement representative within DoD authorized to receive such information.</p>
                    <p id="p-22" data-page="65511">The objective of the rule is to implement the DoD-specific statute that removes restrictions on the ability of employees to report waste, fraud, or abuse to the appropriate DoD authorities.</p>
                    <p id="p-23" data-page="65511">There were no significant issues raised by the public in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis.</p>
                    <p id="p-24" data-page="65511">This rule will apply to all small entities that are eligible to receive DoD contracts; however, the requirements of section 883 are already met through the Governmentwide implementation of a previously published prohibition at FAR 3.909 and in the System for Award Management (SAM) representations and certifications. As a result, the 361,000 unique small entities registered in SAM as of January 12, 2021, are already compliant with these requirements and will not be required to take any additional action to comply with the DoD-specific prohibition in section 883.</p>
                    <p id="p-25" data-page="65511">The rule does not impose any new reporting, recordkeeping, or compliance requirements.</p>
                    <p id="p-26" data-page="65511">There are no practical alternatives that will accomplish the objectives of the statute.</p>

                    <p id="p-27" data-page="65511">This rule does not contain any information collection requirements that require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/44/3501" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44 U.S.C. chapter 35</a>).</p>
