                <p id="p-7" data-page="65563">
                    DoD published a proposed rule in the 
                    <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                     at <a href="/citation/81-FR-17050" class="fr-reference" data-reference="81 FR 17050">81 FR 17050</a> on March 25, 2016. This final rule implements section 2801 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/112/public/81" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 112-81</a>). Section 2801 amends <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2306" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2306</a> by prohibiting any form of cost-plus contracting for military construction projects or military family housing projects. Three respondents submitted public comments in response to the proposed rule.
                </p>
                <h2 id="h-8">II. Discussion and Analysis</h2>
                <p id="p-8" data-page="65563">DoD reviewed the public comments in the development of the final rule. A discussion of the comments and the changes made to the rule as a result of those comments is provided, as follows:</p>
                <h3 id="h-9">A. Summary of Significant Changes from the Proposed Rule</h3>
                <p id="p-9" data-page="65563">
                    There are minor changes to the DFARS text from the proposed rule

                    based on the public comments. A list of the specific cost-reimbursement contract types prohibited has been included at DFARS 216.301-3, Limitations. At DFARS 236.215 the terminology was expanded to state &ldquo;contracts in connection with a military construction project or military family housing project&rdquo; in lieu of &ldquo;contracts for construction.&rdquo; Additionally, at DFARS 236.271, the reference to 236.271 to the prohibition on use of &ldquo;cost-plus&rdquo; contracts was revised to refer to &ldquo;cost-reimbursement&rdquo; contracts.

                <p id="p-10" data-page="65564">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     One respondent expressed support for the proposed rule, indicating that a blanket prohibition on cost-plus contracting in military construction and family housing projects is in the best interest of all parties, including small businesses and taxpayers.

                <p id="p-12" data-page="65564">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     One respondent opposed a blanket prohibition of cost-plus contracts stating that the rule excludes advances and innovations in the marketplace by prohibiting the selection of this form of contracting for construction projects.
                </p>
                <p id="p-13" data-page="65564">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     DoD does not have discretion in this rule as the prohibition is statutory and required by <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2306" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2306(c)</a>.

                <p id="p-14" data-page="65564">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     One respondent expressed concern that the term &ldquo;cost-plus contract,&rdquo; as used in the proposed rule is nonstandard within <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-48" class="cfr external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">title 48 of the Code of Federal R</a>egulation, and as such should be further defined.
                </p>
                <p id="p-15" data-page="65564">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     In the context of the proposed DFARS revisions, &ldquo;cost-plus&rdquo; was interpreted as meaning those &ldquo;cost-reimbursement&rdquo; contract types defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation 16.304, 16.305, and 16.306. Further delineation, however, is added to DFARS 216.301-3 to list the specific contract types prohibited: Cost-plus-fixed-fee, cost-plus-award-fee, and cost-plus-incentive-fee. Additionally, the reference in DFARS 236.271 to use of any cost-plus contract is revised to refer to the list of cost-reimbursement contracts at DFARS 216.301-3.

                <h4 id="h-14">4. Cross Reference to Statute</h4>
                <p id="p-16" data-page="65564">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     One respondent proposed that DoD remove the cross reference to <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2306" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2306(c)</a> as the prohibition should remain notwithstanding any future changes that might be made to <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2306" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2306(c)</a>.

                    <em>Response:</em>
                     It is a DFARS drafting convention to indicate in the regulations if they are based on a statute. This is helpful when considering future amendments to, or deviations from, the regulations. If the statute changes, appropriate changes to the regulations may be required.

                <h2 id="h-15">III. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563</h2>
                <p id="p-18" data-page="65564">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under section 6(b) of <a href="/executive-order/12866" class="eo">E.O. 12866</a>, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993. This rule is not a major rule under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/804" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 804</a>.</p>
                <h2 id="h-16">V. Regulatory Flexibility Act</h2>
                <p id="p-19" data-page="65564">
                    A final regulatory flexibility analysis (FRFA) has been prepared consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/601" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 601</a>, 
                    <em>et seq.</em>
                     The FRFA is summarized as follows:
                </p>
                <p id="p-20" data-page="65564">The purpose of this rule is to amend the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) to implement section 2801 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, which amends <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2306" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2306</a>, to prohibit any form of cost-plus contracting for military construction projects or military family housing projects.</p>
                <p id="p-21" data-page="65564">No comments were received from the public regarding the initial regulatory flexibility analysis.</p>
                <p id="p-22" data-page="65564">There is minimal impact anticipated on small entities as a result of the proposed rule. Based on data available in the Federal Procurement Data System, there were only 19 cost-reimbursement type construction contracts awarded in fiscal year 2015, two of which were awarded to small businesses. There is already a general prohibition at DFARS 216.306 on certain cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts funded by a military construction appropriations act. The proposed rule expands this prohibition to all cost-plus contract types in connection with a military construction project or a military family housing project.</p>
                <p id="p-23" data-page="65564">There are no new projected reporting, recordkeeping, and other compliance requirements of the rule.</p>
                <p id="p-24" data-page="65564">There are no known significant alternatives to the rule that would meet the requirements of the statute.</p>
                <h2 id="h-17">VI. Paperwork Reduction Act</h2>
                <p id="p-25" data-page="65564">The rule does not contain any information collection requirements that require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/44/3501" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44 U.S.C. chapter 35</a>).</p>
