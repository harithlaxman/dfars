                    DoD published a proposed rule in the 
                    <strong>Federal Register</strong>

Comments received in response to DFARS Case 2019-D029 were addressed in the second proposed rule, DFARS Case 2020-D033.
                </p>
                <p id="p-8" data-page="25141">Section 848 modified <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2380" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2380(b)</a> to provide that a contract for an item using FAR part 12 procedures shall serve as a prior commercial item determination, unless the appropriate official determines in writing that the use of such procedures was improper or that it is no longer appropriate to acquire the item using commercial item acquisition procedures.

                    <em>Response:</em>
                     DoD acknowledges that examples of &ldquo;other evidence&rdquo; may be helpful; however, since it not feasible to provide an all-inclusive list of what might constitute &ldquo;other evidence,&rdquo; examples may hinder contracting officers' ability to exercise sound business judgment on a case-by-case basis. DFARS 212.102(a)(ii) already provides that the prior contract may be utilized.

                <p id="p-14" data-page="25142">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     Two respondents recommended revising the proposed rule to clarify that if a prior FAR part 12 contract exists, a new commercial item determination is not required, and another respondent indicated the contracting officer should not be required to perform a search of the commercial item database.

                <p id="p-15" data-page="25142">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     As a result of a similar public comment received in response to the proposed rule published under DFARS Case 2019-D029, DFARS paragraph 212.102(a)(iii) was moved to 212.102(a)(ii) to precede the paragraph on commercial item determinations. At the same time, the coverage was rewritten to shift emphasis to the use of prior commercial item determinations and use of prior acquisitions conducted using FAR part 12 commercial item acquisition procedures as a determination. Additionally, there are circumstances in which the prior use of FAR part 12 procedures was for items that were not commercial items but rather items that were only &ldquo;treated as commercial items&rdquo; (
                    <em>i.e.,</em>
                     procured under the authority of <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1903" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1903</a> or <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2380a" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2380a</a>). Therefore, the use of FAR part 12 procedures under these circumstances could not be used as a prior commercial item determination. Furthermore, the applicability of statutory exceptions to treat certain items as commercial is not dependent upon the particular items being purchased; rather it is dependent upon the circumstances of the particular acquisition that cannot be extrapolated to other acquisitions of the same item(s). As such, a contracting officer cannot infer that the use of FAR part 12 procedures means that the acquisition is always appropriate to serve as a commercial item determination, and a review of the commercial item database may be warranted.

                    <em>Response:</em>
                     Section 848 of the NDAA for FY 2018 modified <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2380" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2380</a> to preclude the need for a commercial item determination under certain circumstances. This rule allows for the reliance on a prior commercial item determination or &ldquo;some other evidence;&rdquo; therefore, this rule will minimize the contract file documentation required where a prior commercial item determination exists. However, that does not preclude the contracting officer's responsibility to conduct market research and to document the file accordingly.

                     A respondent recommended the Commercial Item Database reference be placed in DFARS Procedures, Guidance, and Information (PGI) rather than at DFARS 212.102(a)(ii) since section 848 of the NDAA for FY 2018 does not address it.

                     Although the Commercial Item Database is not referenced in section 848 of the NDAA for FY 2018, it is mandated by <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2380" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2380(a)</a>; therefore, it is appropriate to reference it at the DFARS level.

                <p id="p-22" data-page="25142">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     A respondent indicated the requirement to obtain higher level approval at DFARS 212.102(a)(iii)(C) should be removed.
                </p>
                <p id="p-23" data-page="25142">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The higher level approval at DFARS 212.102(a)(iii)(C) is applicable when the &ldquo;Prior use of FAR part 12 procedures&rdquo; at DFARS 212.102(a)(ii) is not applicable, and the commercial item determination relies on paragraphs (1)(ii), (3), or (4) of the &ldquo;commercial product&rdquo; definition at FAR 2.101 or paragraph (2) of the &ldquo;commercial service&rdquo; definition at FAR 2.101. The requirement for higher level approval was added to the DFARS on March 12, 2012, as a result of a recommendation of the Panel on Contracting Integrity included in its 2009 Report to Congress concerning compliance with the DFARS documentation requirements for commercial item determinations. In its report, the Panel concluded that determinations were not always sufficiently documented; therefore, the DFARS was modified to require approval at one level above the contracting officer for commercial acquisitions that are based on &ldquo;of a type&rdquo; commercial procurements or items &ldquo;offered for sale&rdquo; but not yet sold to the general public. This approval does not conflict with the changes made to <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2380" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2380</a> by section 848 of the NDAA for FY 2018, and the basis for it is still valid.

                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     A respondent recommended the Commercial Item Database be expanded to include information regarding commercial awards.

                    <em>Response:</em><a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2380" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2380(a)</a> sets forth the requirements for the Commercial Item Database, whereas information regarding contract awards is available via other means such as the Federal Procurement Data System; therefore, it is not necessary to expand the Commercial Item Database to replicate data available elsewhere.
                </p>
                <h3 id="h-13">C. Other Changes</h3>
                <p id="p-26" data-page="25142">DFARS 212.102(a)(iii) is modified to specify that commercial item determinations are only required for acquisitions that exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (SAT). The proposed rule eliminated the $1 million threshold for commercial item determinations, which was based on policy to avoid overly burdensome requirements on lower dollar value acquisitions. If contracting officers are accepting prior use of FAR part 12 procedures, even below $1 million, as a commercial item determination for subsequent buys, then it is necessary to apply the same standards at any dollar value, as these determinations can form the basis for much larger acquisitions. However, requiring commercial item determinations for acquisitions between the micro-purchase threshold and those at or below the SAT would impose an overly burdensome requirement for Government personnel. DoD also recognizes the elimination of the $1 million threshold could result in an administrative burden on contractors if the requirement for a commercial item determination is imposed at or below the SAT. Therefore, DFARS 212.102(a)(iii) is modified to reflect the internal operating procedures of the Government to specify that commercial item determinations are only required for acquisitions that exceed the SAT.</p>

                    This rule does not create any new solicitation provisions or contract clauses. It does not impact any existing solicitation provisions or contract clauses or their applicability to contracts valued at or below the simplified acquisition threshold, for commercial products including

                </p>
                <h2 id="h-15">IV. Expected Impact of the Rule</h2>
                <p id="p-28" data-page="25143">This final rule is expected to benefit the Government and contractors as it streamlines FAR part 12 and commercial item determination processes and procedures. Since this rule will allow a contracting officer to rely on a prior commerciality determination in the Commercial Item Database, a prior contract, or other evidence that an item has previously been procured by DoD using commercial item acquisition procedures under FAR part 12, it will preclude the need to prepare a commercial item determination and, as such, preclude the need for contractors to provide information to the Government to support a commercial item determination. Therefore, this rule is expected to benefit both the Government and contractors. Given that this rule streamlines internal Government processes and procedures and, as a consequence, benefits contractors, there is no expected cost to contractors.</p>

                <p id="p-29" data-page="25143">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a href="/executive-order/13563" class="eo">E.O. 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility.

                <p id="p-32" data-page="25143">This final rule is necessary in order to further implement section 848 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2018, which modified <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2380" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2380(b)</a> (redesignated, as of January 1, 2021, as <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2308" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2308(c)</a> in accordance with section 816 of the NDAA for FY 2021 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/116/public/283" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 116-283</a>)). The objective of this rule is to address the use of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12 procedures and commercial item determinations. If the DoD Commercial Item Database contains a prior commercial item determination, or the contracting officer has other evidence that an item has previously been acquired by DoD using commercial item acquisition procedures under FAR part 12, the prior contract shall serve as a determination that an item is a commercial item.</p>
                <p id="p-33" data-page="25143">No significant issues were raised by the public comments received in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis.</p>
                <p id="p-34" data-page="25143">DoD awarded an average of 24,446 new contracts to an average of 11,297 unique entities (including 7,344 small businesses) each year from FY 2018 through FY 2020. However, this rule is not expected to have a significant impact on small entities because the rule is not implementing any requirements with which small entities must comply. This rule impacts Government internal operating procedures for commercial item determinations for products and services offered to the Government.</p>
                <p id="p-35" data-page="25143">This final rule does not impose any new reporting, recordkeeping, or other compliance requirements.</p>
                <p id="p-36" data-page="25143">DoD did not identify any significant alternatives that would minimize or reduce the significant economic impact on small entities, because no significant impact is expected. Any impact is expected to be beneficial.</p>

                <p id="p-37" data-page="25143">The rule does not contain any information collection requirements that require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/44/3501" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44 U.S.C. chapter 35</a>).</p>
