                <p id="p-6" data-page="31957">
                    DoD published a proposed rule in the 
                    <strong>Federal Register</strong>
                     at <a href="/citation/85-FR-53751" class="fr-reference" data-reference="85 FR 53751">85 FR 53751</a> on August 31, 2020, to implement section 890 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/116/public/92" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pub. L. 116-92</a>). Section 890 prohibits contracts for the procurement of goods and services with any person that has business operations with an authority of the government of Venezuela, subject to exceptions. Six respondents submitted public comments in response to the proposed rule.
                </p>
                <h2 id="h-8">II. Discussion and Analysis</h2>
                <p id="p-7" data-page="31957">DoD reviewed the public comments in the development of the final rule. A discussion of the comments and the changes made to the rule as a result of those comments is provided, as follows:</p>
                <h3 id="h-9">A. Summary of Significant Changes From the Proposed Rule</h3>
                <p id="p-8" data-page="31957">To further clarify and to eliminate any ambiguity, the solicitation provision 252.225-7055, Representation Regarding Business Operations with the Maduro Regime, was revised to clarify that &ldquo;. . . by submission of its offer, the Offeror represents that the Offeror is a person that&mdash;(1) Does not have any business operations with an authority of the Maduro regime or the government of Venezuela that is not recognized as the legitimate government of Venezuela by the U.S. Government; or . . .&rdquo;. The contract clause 252.225-7056, Prohibition Regarding Business Operations with the Maduro Regime, applies to the entity that was awarded the contract. Therefore, no change was made to the clause.</p>
                <p id="p-9" data-page="31957">Additional revisions were made to the text and clause number designations to accommodate updated numerical designations required in the final rule. In addition, a revision was made to 225.7020-4, Joint Determination, to explicitly state that delegation authority is to remain at the level of Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State without power of redelegation.</p>
                <h3 id="h-10">B. Analysis of Public Comments</h3>
                <h4 id="h-11">1. Support for the Rule</h4>
                <p id="p-10" data-page="31957">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     Several respondents provided overall support of the rule. A respondent expressed support for the rule because it is an effectual way to limit the Maduro regime's access to American made or American preferred military technology. The respondent also expressed support for the exceptions for humanitarian aid. Another respondent supported the rule overall because limiting contracts is a push in opposition of the Maduro regime. A respondent commended the rule and hopes this is not a final step in solving unrest in Venezuela.

                <p id="p-11" data-page="31957">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     DoD acknowledges the respondents' support for the rule.
                </p>
                <h4 id="h-12">2. Joint Determination</h4>
                <p id="p-12" data-page="31957">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     A respondent expressed concern that requiring a joint determination of both the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State that the restriction does not apply to certain acquisitions may limit the relief that can be provided to the people of Venezuela. Another respondent expressed similar concern with the high level of approval necessary for the joint determination and also expressed concern with the process for making the joint determination. A respondent included a list of proposed factors to consider in whether to seek a joint determination. A respondent further stated that there were no procedures or guidance on the Government determination process.
                </p>
                <p id="p-13" data-page="31957">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The proposed rule implements section 890 of the NDAA for FY 2020. Section 890 prohibits DoD from entering into a contract for the procurement of goods or services with any person that has business operations with an authority of the government of Venezuela that is not recognized as the legitimate government of Venezuela by the United States Government. Section 890 does not apply the prohibition to acquisitions where the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State have jointly determined that the acquisition is necessary for providing humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, or urgent lifesaving measures to the people of Venezuela; carrying out noncombatant evacuations; or is otherwise vital to U.S. national security interests. The process of the joint determination is in accordance with internal Government operating procedures. The rule's implementation is consistent with the statutory requirements of section 890 and does not allow for further delegation of the authority for the joint determination. Thus, the final rule implements the authority for the joint determination at the level of the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State.
                </p>
                <h4 id="h-13">3. National Security Waiver</h4>
                <p id="p-14" data-page="31957">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     A couple of respondents provided questions relating to the lack of guidelines for securing a national security interest exception in the proposed rule.
                </p>
                <p id="p-15" data-page="31957">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The final rule is directly aligned with the statutory language and implements section 890 of the NDAA for FY 2020. The reference to national security interests appears in section 890(b)(1)(A) and was implemented accordingly in DFARS 225.7020-4(a)(2) of the final rule.
                </p>
                <h4 id="h-14">4. Definitions</h4>
                <p id="p-16" data-page="31957">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     A respondent stated that the definition of &ldquo;person&rdquo; is overly broad and could adversely affect contracts held by businesses that have no operations in, or connections with, Venezuela. Another respondent further stated that in light of the broad definition of &ldquo;person&rdquo; and &ldquo;business operations&rdquo; in the rule, there is a lack of clarity in the solicitation provision 252.225-7055 as to whether an &ldquo;offeror&rdquo; who certifies that it does not have any business operations with an authority of

                    the Maduro regime is submitting such statement on behalf of the offeror with a discrete unique identifier number or Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code or as &ldquo;person&rdquo; is defined under the proposed rule. The respondent also stated that the clause 252.225-7056 is not clear on whether the clause requires the contractor, specifically the legal entity that was awarded the contract, to refrain from engaging in business with the Maduro regime or whether the obligation extends to the contractor's ties within the definition of &ldquo;person&rdquo;.
                </p>
                <p id="p-17" data-page="31958">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     DoD acknowledges the respondent's comment. The final rule implements and is aligned with the statutory language as provided in section 890 of the NDAA for FY 2020. There is no certification requirement per <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1304" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1304</a>; rather there is a representation requirement, which is less burdensome than a certification. To further explain and eliminate any ambiguity, the provision at DFARS 252.225-7055 was revised to clarify that &ldquo;. . . by submission of its offer, the Offeror represents that the Offeror is a person that&mdash;(1) Does not have any business operations with an authority of the Maduro regime or the government of Venezuela that is not recognized as the legitimate government of Venezuela by the U.S. Government; or . . .&rdquo;. The clause at DFARS 252.225-7056 applies to the entity that was awarded the contract. Accordingly, no change was made to the clause. In addition, the definitions, defined in the provision in the proposed rule, are listed and a cross-reference added to point to those terms being defined in the clause.
                </p>
                <h4 id="h-15">5. Adverse Impacts</h4>
                <p id="p-18" data-page="31958">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     A respondent commented that the proposed rule would have adverse effects on U.S. defense programs, force readiness, the defense industrial base, and American workers. The respondent further requested that DoD conduct a review of the law's impact on the defense industrial base, military readiness, DoD acquisition programs as well as the economy and employment. Another respondent stated that implementing the rule without clear guidelines would have impacts to defense contractors.
                </p>
                <p id="p-19" data-page="31958">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The proposed rule implements section 890 of the NDAA for FY 2020 that prohibits contracts for the procurement of goods and services with any person that has business operations with an authority of the government of Venezuela, subject to the listed exceptions. Section 890 does not require a review of the defense industrial base, military readiness, DoD acquisition programs, the economy, or employment. Consequently, the rule implements the prohibition in accordance with section 890 of the NDAA for FY 2020 and unless certain exceptions apply requires contracting officers to include the provision and the clause in solicitations and contracts, including those for the acquisition of commercial items, and prohibits the award of a contract to a prohibited entity in accordance with the associated policy guidance.

                <h4 id="h-16">6. Extension Request</h4>
                <p id="p-20" data-page="31958">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     A couple of respondents requested an extension to the comment period for additional time to provide comments.
                </p>
                <p id="p-21" data-page="31958">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     DoD acknowledges the extension request. The public comment period was not extended.

                <h4 id="h-17">7. Out of Scope</h4>
                <h4 id="h-18">a. Mitigation Measures</h4>
                <p id="p-22" data-page="31958">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     A respondent stated the proposed rule does not contain any mitigation measures that would enable an American subsidiary that is ultimately foreign-owned to provide goods and services to DoD irrespective of how tangentially related another entity, that has business operations with the Maduro regime, may be to the U.S. company. The respondent further stated the rule poses a real impediment to the DoD's ability to contract with companies that offer mission-critical, lifesaving products and services to service members.
                </p>
                <p id="p-23" data-page="31958">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The comment is outside the scope of the rule. The final rule implements section 890 of the NDAA for FY 2020 and prohibits contracts for the procurement of goods and services with any person that has business operations with an authority of the government of Venezuela, subject to listed statutory exceptions. The statutory prohibition in section 890 does not allow for mitigation measures.
                </p>
                <h4 id="h-19">b. Additional Policy</h4>
                <p id="p-24" data-page="31958">
                    <em>Comment:</em>
                     A respondent recommended the U.S. Government go further than this rule and adopt the recommendations outlined in the Atlantic Council's article titled &ldquo;The Maduro Regime's Illicit Activities: A Threat to Democracy in Venezuela and Security in Latin America&rdquo;. The article calls for a task force comprised of various U.S. Government agencies that would focus on the alleged criminal enterprises around the Maduro regime.
                </p>
                <p id="p-25" data-page="31958">
                    <em>Response:</em>
                     The comment is outside the scope of the rule. The prohibition in section 890 of the NDAA for FY 2020 does not include requirements for a task force or the recommended additional policy measures. The final rule implements the statutory requirements in section 890, subject to the listed statutory exceptions and prohibits contracts for the procurement of goods and services with any person that has business operations with an authority of the government of Venezuela.
                </p>
                <h3 id="h-20">C. Other Changes</h3>
                <p id="p-26" data-page="31958">The following changes have been made throughout the final rule:</p>

                <p id="p-29" data-page="31958">This rule creates a new provision and a new clause: (1) DFARS 252.225-7055, Representation Regarding Business Operations with the Maduro Regime; and (2) DFARS 252.225-7056, Prohibition Regarding Business Operations with the Maduro Regime. DoD applies the provision and the clause to solicitations, contracts, or subcontracts at or below the simplified acquisition threshold (SAT) and to the acquisition of commercial services and commercial products, including commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) items, as defined at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 2.101. This DFARS rule implements section 890 of the NDAA for FY 2020. Section 890 prohibits contracts for the procurement of goods and services with any person that has business operations with an authority of the government of Venezuela, subject to exceptions.</p>

                <p id="p-37" data-page="31959">Section 890 of the NDAA for FY 2020 is silent on applicability to contracts and subcontracts in amounts no greater than the SAT or for the acquisition of commercial services and commercial products including COTS items. Also, the statute does not provide for civil or criminal penalties. Therefore, it does not apply to contracts or subcontracts in amounts not greater than the SAT or to the acquisition of commercial products and commercial services unless the Principal Director, Defense Pricing and Contracting, makes a written determination as provided in <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/41/1905" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">41 U.S.C. 1905</a> and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/2375" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 U.S.C. 2375</a>.</p>
                <p id="p-38" data-page="31959">Not applying this rule to contracts and subcontracts at or below the SAT and for the acquisition of commercial services and commercial products, including COTS items, would exclude contracts intended to be covered by this rule and undermine the overarching purpose of the rule, which is to prohibit contracts for the procurement of goods and services with any person that has business operations with an authority of the government of Venezuela, subject to the listed exceptions. This is particularly true with regard to the acquisition of fuel and petroleum, procurements which are usually commercial products and commercial services. To not include the acquisition of fuel and petroleum within this prohibition or to not apply the prohibition at or below the SAT will unacceptably diminish the impact of these sanctions on the Maduro regime, the government of Venezuela that is not recognized by the United States Government as the legitimate government of Venezuela. Subsequently, DoD has applied the rule to contracts and subcontracts at or below the SAT and for the acquisition of commercial services and commercial products, including COTS items.</p>
                <h2 id="h-25">IV. Expected Impact of the Rule</h2>
                <p id="p-39" data-page="31959">This rule creates new DFARS provision 252.225-7055, Representation Regarding Business Operations with the Maduro Regime, and new clause 252.225-7056, Prohibition Regarding Business Operations with the Maduro Regime. The new provision and clause are prescribed at 225.7020-5(a) and (b). DoD has applied the requirements of section 890 of the NDAA for FY 2020 to contracts at or below the SAT. Section 890 prohibits DoD from entering into a contract for the procurement of products or services with any person that has business operations with an authority of the government of Venezuela that is not recognized as the legitimate government of Venezuela by the United States Government subject to the listed exceptions.</p>
                <p id="p-40" data-page="31959">The rule does not add any new burden. Contracting officers will include the provision and the clause in solicitations and contracts, including solicitations and contracts using FAR part 12 procedures for the acquisition of commercial services and commercial products including COTS items, unless an exception at 225.7020-3(b) applies or a joint determination has been made in accordance with 225.7020-4.</p>
